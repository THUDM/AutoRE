1378968	Effects of uninephrectomy and high protein feeding on lithium - induced chronic renal failure in rats .|Rats with lithium - induced nephropathy were subjected to high protein ( HP ) feeding , uninephrectomy ( NX ) or a combination of these , in an attempt to induce glomerular hyperfiltration and further progression of renal failure .|Newborn female Wistar rats were fed a lithium - containing diet ( 50 mmol / kg ) for 8 weeks and then randomized to normal diet , HP diet ( 40 vs . 19 % ) , NX or HP + NX for another 8 weeks .|Corresponding non - lithium pretreated groups were generated .|When comparing all lithium treated versus non - lithium - treated groups , lithium caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow ( as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules ) or lithium clearance .|Consequently , lithium pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional Li excretion .|Lithium also caused proteinuria and systolic hypertension in absence of glomerulosclerosis .|HP failed to accentuante progression of renal failure and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma creatinine levels in lithium pretreated rats .|NX caused an additive deterioration in GFR which , however , was ameliorated by HP .|NX + HP caused a further rise in blood pressure in Li - pretreated rats .|The results indicate that Li - induced nephropathy , even when the GFR is only modestly reduced , is associated with proteinuria and arterial systolic hypertension .|In this model of chronic renal failure the decline in GFR is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow , which may be the functional expression of the formation of nonfiltrating atubular glomeruli .|The fractional reabsorption of tubular fluid by the proximal tubules is reduced , leaving the distal delivery unchanged .

2670794	Effects of an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme ( Captopril ) on pulmonary and renal insufficiency due to intravascular coagulation in the rat .|Induction of intravascular coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis by injection of thrombin and tranexamic acid ( AMCA ) in the rat gives rise to pulmonary and renal insufficiency resembling that occurring after trauma or sepsis in man .|Injection of Captopril ( 1 mg / kg ) , an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) , reduced both pulmonary and renal insufficiency in this rat model .|The lung weights were lower and PaO2 was improved in rats given this enzyme - blocking agent .|The contents of albumin in the lungs were not changed , indicating that Captopril did not influence the extravasation of protein .|Renal damage as reflected by an increase in serum urea and in kidney weight was prevented by Captopril .|The amount of fibrin in the kidneys was also considerably lower than in animals which received thrombin and AMCA alone .|It is suggested that the effects of Captopril on the lungs may be attributable to a vasodilatory effect due to a reduction in the circulating level of Angiotension II and an increase in prostacyclin ( secondary to an increase in bradykinin ) .|Captopril may , by the same mechanism , reduce the increase in glomerular filtration that is known to occur after an injection of thrombin , thereby diminishing the aggregation of fibrin monomers in the glomeruli , with the result that less fibrin will be deposited and thus less kidney damage will be produced

3192036	Death from chemotherapy in gestational trophoblastic disease .|Multiple cytotoxic drug administration is the generally accepted treatment of patients with a high - risk stage of choriocarcinoma .|Based on this principle a 27 - year old woman , classified as being in the high - risk group ( Goldstein and Berkowitz score : 11 ) , was treated with multiple cytotoxic drugs .|The multiple drug schema consisted of : Etoposide 16 . 213 , Methotrexate , Cyclophosphamide , Actomycin - D , and Cisplatin .|On the first day of the schedule , moderate high doses of Methotrexate , Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide were administered .|Within 8 hours after initiation of therapy the patient died with a clinical picture resembling massive pulmonary obstruction due to choriocarcinomic tissue plugs , probably originating from the uterus .|Formation of these plugs was probably due to extensive tumor necrosis at the level of the walls of the major uterine veins , which resulted in an open exchange of tumor plugs to the vascular spaces ; decrease in tumor tissue coherence secondary to chemotherapy may have further contributed to the formation of tumor emboli .|In view of the close time association between the start of chemotherapy and the acute onset of massive embolism other explanations , such as spontaneous necrosis , must be considered less likely .|Patients with large pelvic tumor loads are , according to existing classifications , at high risk to die and to develop drug resistance .|Notwithstanding these facts our findings suggest that these patients might benefit from relatively mild initial treatment , especially true for patients not previously exposed to this drug .|Close observation of the response status both clinically and with beta - hCG values may indicate whether and when more agressive combination chemotherapy should be started .

doses of metoprolol ( 100 mg t . i . d .|and then 100 mg b . i . d . ) had been initiated .|Two days before admission diltiazem ( 60 mg b . i . d . ) was prescribed in addition .|Analyses of a blood sample revealed unusually high plasma concentrations of metoprolol ( greater than 3000 ng / ml ) and diltiazem ( 526 ng / ml ) .|The patient recovered within 1 week following discontinuation of antianginal therapy .|Three months later the patient was exposed to a single dose of metoprolol , diltiazem , propafenone ( since he had received this drug in the past ) , and sparteine ( as a probe for the debrisoquine / sparteine type polymorphism of oxidative drug metabolism ) .|It was found that he was a poor metabolizer of all four drugs , indicating that their metabolism is under the same genetic control .|Therefore , patients belonging to the poor - metabolizer phenotype of sparteine / debrisoquine polymorphism in drug metabolism , which constitutes 6 . 4 % of the German population , may experience adverse drug reactions when treated with standard doses of one of these drugs alone .|Moreover , the coadministration of these frequently used drugs is expected to be especially harmful

3780846	On the mechanisms of the development of tolerance to the muscular rigidity produced by morphine in rats .|The development of tolerance to the muscular rigidity produced by morphine was studied in rats .|Saline - pretreated controls given a test dose of morphine ( 20 mg / kg i . p . ) showed a pronounced rigidity recorded as tonic activity in the electromyogram .|Rats treated for 11 days with morphine and withdrawn for 36 - 40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance : about half of the animals showed a rigidity after the test dose of morphine that was not significantly less than in the controls and were akinetic ( A group ) .|The other rats showed a strong decrease in the rigidity and the occurrence of stereotyped ( S ) licking and / or gnawing in presence of akinetic or hyperkinetic ( K ) behaviour ( AS / KS group ) , suggesting signs of dopaminergic activation .|The rigidity was considerably decreased in both groups after 20 days ' treatment .|In a further series of experiments , haloperidol ( 0 . 2 mg / kg i . p . ) was used in order to block the dopaminergic activation and to estimate the real degree of the tolerance to the rigidity without any dopaminergic interference .|Haloperidol enhanced the rigidity in the A group .|However , the level in the AS / KS group remained considerably lower than in the A group .|The results suggest that rigidity , which is assumed to be due to an action of morphine in the striatum , can be antagonized by another process leading to dopaminergic activation in the striatum .|Nevertheless , there occurs some real tolerance to this effect .|The rapid alternations of rigidity and the signs of dopaminergic activation observed in the animals of the AS / KS group might be due to rapid shifts in the predominance of various DA - innervated structures .	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	14-15	10-12	D009020	morphine|morphine|morphine|morphine|morphine|morphine	Chemical	14:28:43:72:101:269	15:29:44:73:102:270	0:1:2:3:3:9	D009127	muscular rigidity|muscular rigidity|rigidity|rigidity|rigidity|rigidity|rigidity|rigidity|rigidity|rigidity	Disease	10:24:57:95:128:166:219:228:257:303	12:26:58:96:129:167:220:229:258:304	0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:9:11	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	228-229	225-226	D006220	haloperidol|Haloperidol	Chemical	186:225	187:226	6:7	D009127	muscular rigidity|muscular rigidity|rigidity|rigidity|rigidity|rigidity|rigidity|rigidity|rigidity|rigidity	Disease	10:24:57:95:128:166:219:228:257:303	12:26:58:96:129:167:220:229:258:304	0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:9:11	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	101-102	113-114	D009020	morphine|morphine|morphine|morphine|morphine|morphine	Chemical	14:28:43:72:101:269	15:29:44:73:102:270	0:1:2:3:3:9	D018476	akinetic|akinetic	Disease	113:145	114:146	3:4	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	101-102	147-148	D009020	morphine|morphine|morphine|morphine|morphine|morphine	Chemical	14:28:43:72:101:269	15:29:44:73:102:270	0:1:2:3:3:9	D006948	hyperkinetic	Disease	147	148	4	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	186-187	145-146	D006220	haloperidol|Haloperidol	Chemical	186:225	187:226	6:7	D018476	akinetic|akinetic	Disease	113:145	114:146	3:4	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	186-187	147-148	D006220	haloperidol|Haloperidol	Chemical	186:225	187:226	6:7	D006948	hyperkinetic	Disease	147	148	4

P = 0 . 047 ) .|CONCLUSIONS : The combination of GEM and VNB is moderately active and well tolerated except in patients age > / = 75 years .|This age group had an increased risk of myelosuppression .|Therefore the prophylactic use of granulocyte - colony stimulating factor should be considered with this treatment .|New chemotherapy combinations with higher activity and lower toxicity are needed for elderly patients with advanced NSCLC .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	0-1	4-8	C056507	Gemcitabine|gemcitabine|GEM|GEM|GEM|GEM	Chemical	0:75:77:117:199:458	1:76:78:118:200:459	0:3:3:4:7:19	D002289	nonsmall cell lung carcinoma|nonsmall cell lung carcinoma|NSCLC|NSCLC|NSCLC|NSCLC	Disease	4:32:37:125:145:520	8:36:38:126:146:521	0:2:2:4:5:22	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	112-113	117-118	C056507	Gemcitabine|gemcitabine|GEM|GEM|GEM|GEM	Chemical	0:75:77:117:199:458	1:76:78:118:200:459	0:3:3:4:7:19	D064420	toxicity|toxicity|toxicity|toxicity|Toxicity|toxicity	Disease	53:95:112:182:359:512	54:96:113:183:360:513	2:3:4:6:15:22	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	428-429	458-459	C056507	Gemcitabine|gemcitabine|GEM|GEM|GEM|GEM	Chemical	0:75:77:117:199:458	1:76:78:118:200:459	0:3:3:4:7:19	D009503	neutropenia|neutropenia|neutropenia	Disease	377:408:428	378:409:429	16:17:18	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	390-391	458-459	C056507	Gemcitabine|gemcitabine|GEM|GEM|GEM|GEM	Chemical	0:75:77:117:199:458	1:76:78:118:200:459	0:3:3:4:7:19	D013921	thrombocytopenia	Disease	390	391	16	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	402-403	458-459	C056507	Gemcitabine|gemcitabine|GEM|GEM|GEM|GEM	Chemical	0:75:77:117:199:458	1:76:78:118:200:459	0:3:3:4:7:19	D020258	neurotoxicity	Disease	402	403	16	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	415-416	458-459	C056507	Gemcitabine|gemcitabine|GEM|GEM|GEM|GEM	Chemical	0:75:77:117:199:458	1:76:78:118:200:459	0:3:3:4:7:19	D018805	sepsis	Disease	415	416	17	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	458-459	485-486	C056507	Gemcitabine|gemcitabine|GEM|GEM|GEM|GEM	Chemical	0:75:77:117:199:458	1:76:78:118:200:459	0:3:3:4:7:19	D001855	myelosuppression	Disease	485	486	20	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	2-3	4-8	C030852	vinorelbine|vinorelbine|VNB|VNB|VNB|VNB	Chemical	2:70:72:119:188:460	3:71:73:120:189:461	0:3:3:4:7:19	D002289	nonsmall cell lung carcinoma|nonsmall cell lung carcinoma|NSCLC|NSCLC|NSCLC|NSCLC	Disease	4:32:37:125:145:520	8:36:38:126:146:521	0:2:2:4:5:22	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	182-183	188-189	C030852	vinorelbine|vinorelbine|VNB|VNB|VNB|VNB	Chemical	2:70:72:119:188:460	3:71:73:120:189:461	0:3:3:4:7:19	D064420	toxicity|toxicity|toxicity|toxicity|Toxicity|toxicity	Disease	53:95:112:182:359:512	54:96:113:183:360:513	2:3:4:6:15:22	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	428-429	460-461	C030852	vinorelbine|vinorelbine|VNB|VNB|VNB|VNB	Chemical	2:70:72:119:188:460	3:71:73:120:189:461	0:3:3:4:7:19	D009503	neutropenia|neutropenia|neutropenia	Disease	377:408:428	378:409:429	16:17:18	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	390-391	460-461	C030852	vinorelbine|vinorelbine|VNB|VNB|VNB|VNB	Chemical	2:70:72:119:188:460	3:71:73:120:189:461	0:3:3:4:7:19	D013921	thrombocytopenia	Disease	390	391	16	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	402-403	460-461	C030852	vinorelbine|vinorelbine|VNB|VNB|VNB|VNB	Chemical	2:70:72:119:188:460	3:71:73:120:189:461	0:3:3:4:7:19	D020258	neurotoxicity	Disease	402	403	16	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	415-416	460-461	C030852	vinorelbine|vinorelbine|VNB|VNB|VNB|VNB	Chemical	2:70:72:119:188:460	3:71:73:120:189:461	0:3:3:4:7:19	D018805	sepsis	Disease	415	416	17	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	460-461	485-486	C030852	vinorelbine|vinorelbine|VNB|VNB|VNB|VNB	Chemical	2:70:72:119:188:460	3:71:73:120:189:461	0:3:3:4:7:19	D001855	myelosuppression	Disease	485	486	20	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	133-134	125-126	D002945	cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	20:133:173	21:134:174	0:4:5	D002289	nonsmall cell lung carcinoma|nonsmall cell lung carcinoma|NSCLC|NSCLC|NSCLC|NSCLC	Disease	4:32:37:125:145:520	8:36:38:126:146:521	0:2:2:4:5:22	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	173-174	182-183	D002945	cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	20:133:173	21:134:174	0:4:5	D064420	toxicity|toxicity|toxicity|toxicity|Toxicity|toxicity	Disease	53:95:112:182:359:512	54:96:113:183:360:513	2:3:4:6:15:22	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	173-174	377-378	D002945	cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	20:133:173	21:134:174	0:4:5	D009503	neutropenia|neutropenia|neutropenia	Disease	377:408:428	378:409:429	16:17:18	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	173-174	390-391	D002945	cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	20:133:173	21:134:174	0:4:5	D013921	thrombocytopenia	Disease	390	391	16	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	173-174	402-403	D002945	cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	20:133:173	21:134:174	0:4:5	D020258	neurotoxicity	Disease	402	403	16	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	173-174	415-416	D002945	cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	20:133:173	21:134:174	0:4:5	D018805	sepsis	Disease	415	416	17	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	173-174	485-486	D002945	cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	20:133:173	21:134:174	0:4:5	D001855	myelosuppression	Disease	485	486	20
10669626	Warfarin - induced artery calcification is accelerated by growth and vitamin D .|The present studies demonstrate that growth and vitamin D treatment enhance the extent of artery calcification in rats given sufficient doses of Warfarin to inhibit gamma - carboxylation of matrix Gla protein , a calcification inhibitor known to be expressed by smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the artery wall .|The first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on artery calcification in Warfarin - treated rats .|Treatment for 2 weeks with Warfarin caused massive focal calcification of the artery media in 20 - day - old rats and less extensive focal calcification in 42 - day - old rats .|In contrast , no artery calcification could be detected in 10 - month - old adult rats even after 4 weeks of Warfarin treatment .|To directly examine the importance of growth to Warfarin - induced artery calcification in animals of the same age , 20 - day - old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6 - g / d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth .|Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with Warfarin produced massive focal calcification of the artery media in the ad libitum - fed rats but no detectable artery calcification in the restricted - diet , growth - inhibited group .|Although the explanation for the association between artery calcification and growth status can not be determined from the present study , there was a relationship between higher serum phosphate and susceptibility to artery calcification , with 30 % higher levels of serum phosphate in young , ad libitum - fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to Warfarin - induced artery calcification , ie , the 10 - month - old rats and the restricted - diet , growth - inhibited young rats .|This observation suggests that increased susceptibility to Warfarin - induced artery calcification could be related to higher serum phosphate levels .|The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between vitamin D and Warfarin in artery calcification .|High doses of vitamin D are known to cause calcification of the artery media in as little as 3 to 4 days .|High doses of the vitamin K antagonist Warfarin are also known to cause calcification of the artery media , but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week .|In the current study , we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent Warfarin administration dramatically increased the extent of calcification in the media of vitamin D - treated rats at 3 and 4 days .|There was a close parallel between the effect of vitamin D dose on artery calcification and the effect of vitamin D dose on the elevation of serum calcium , which suggests that vitamin D may induce artery calcification through its effect on serum calcium .|Because Warfarin treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin D , the synergy between Warfarin and vitamin D is probably best explained by the hypothesis that Warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a calcification inhibitor .|High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of artery calcification in rats treated with vitamin D plus Warfarin , and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not gamma - carboxylated .|These observations indicate that although the gamma - carboxyglutamate residues of matrix Gla protein are apparently required for its function as a calcification inhibitor , they are not required for its accumulation at calcification sites .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	358-359	360-362	D014859	Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin	Chemical	0:35:81:91:142:153:204:297:331:358:393:437:506:525:537:570	1:36:82:92:143:154:205:298:332:359:394:438:507:526:538:571	0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:11:12:14:14:14:15	D061205	artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|calcification of the artery|artery calcification|artery calcification|calcification of the artery|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|calcification of the artery|calcification of the artery|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification	Disease	3:27:78:95:124:156:208:223:243:268:300:334:360:372:399:473:496:561	5:29:80:99:126:158:212:225:245:270:302:336:362:376:403:475:498:563	0:1:2:3:4:5:6:6:7:7:7:8:9:10:11:13:13:15	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	437-438	444-445	D014859	Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin|Warfarin	Chemical	0:35:81:91:142:153:204:297:331:358:393:437:506:525:537:570	1:36:82:92:143:154:205:298:332:359:394:438:507:526:538:571	0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:11:12:14:14:14:15	D002114	calcification|calcification|calcification|calcification|calcification|calcification	Disease	47:111:444:547:610:621	48:112:445:548:611:622	1:3:12:14:16:16	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	496-498	492-494	D014807	vitamin D|vitamin D|vitamin D|vitamin D|vitamin D|vitamin D|vitamin D|vitamin D|vitamin D|vitamin D|vitamin D	Chemical	10:20:355:366:449:469:479:492:519:527:567	12:22:357:368:451:471:481:494:521:529:569	0:1:9:10:12:13:13:13:14:14:15	D061205	artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|calcification of the artery|artery calcification|artery calcification|calcification of the artery|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|calcification of the artery|calcification of the artery|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification	Disease	3:27:78:95:124:156:208:223:243:268:300:334:360:372:399:473:496:561	5:29:80:99:126:158:212:225:245:270:302:336:362:376:403:475:498:563	0:1:2:3:4:5:6:6:7:7:7:8:9:10:11:13:13:15	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	268-270	264-265	D010710	phosphate|phosphate|phosphate	Chemical	264:278:342	265:279:343	7:7:8	D061205	artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|calcification of the artery|artery calcification|artery calcification|calcification of the artery|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|calcification of the artery|calcification of the artery|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification	Disease	3:27:78:95:124:156:208:223:243:268:300:334:360:372:399:473:496:561	5:29:80:99:126:158:212:225:245:270:302:336:362:376:403:475:498:563	0:1:2:3:4:5:6:6:7:7:7:8:9:10:11:13:13:15	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	399-403	390-392	D014812	vitamin K	Chemical	390	392	11	D061205	artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|calcification of the artery|artery calcification|artery calcification|calcification of the artery|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|calcification of the artery|calcification of the artery|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification	Disease	3:27:78:95:124:156:208:223:243:268:300:334:360:372:399:473:496:561	5:29:80:99:126:158:212:225:245:270:302:336:362:376:403:475:498:563	0:1:2:3:4:5:6:6:7:7:7:8:9:10:11:13:13:15	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	503-504	496-498	D002118	calcium|calcium|calcium	Chemical	487:503:516	488:504:517	13:13:14	D061205	artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|calcification of the artery|artery calcification|artery calcification|calcification of the artery|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification|calcification of the artery|calcification of the artery|artery calcification|artery calcification|artery calcification	Disease	3:27:78:95:124:156:208:223:243:268:300:334:360:372:399:473:496:561	5:29:80:99:126:158:212:225:245:270:302:336:362:376:403:475:498:563	0:1:2:3:4:5:6:6:7:7:7:8:9:10:11:13:13:15	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	584-587	561-563	D015055	gamma -

11379838	Antidepressant - induced mania in bipolar patients : identification of risk factors .|BACKGROUND : Concerns about possible risks of switching to mania associated with antidepressants continue to interfere with the establishment of an optimal treatment paradigm for bipolar depression .|METHOD : The response of 44 patients meeting DSM - IV criteria for bipolar disorder to naturalistic treatment was assessed for at least 6 weeks using the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Bech - Rafaelson Mania Rating Scale .|Patients who experienced a manic or hypomanic switch were compared with those who did not on several variables including age , sex , diagnosis ( DSM - IV bipolar I vs . bipolar II ) , number of previous manic episodes , type of antidepressant therapy used ( electroconvulsive therapy vs . antidepressant drugs and , more particularly , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [ SSRIs ] ) , use and type of mood stabilizers ( lithium vs . anticonvulsants ) , and temperament of the patient , assessed during a normothymic period using the hyperthymia component of the Semi - structured Affective Temperament Interview .|RESULTS : Switches to hypomania or mania occurred in 27 % of all patients ( N = 12 ) ( and in 24 % of the subgroup of patients treated with SSRIs [ 8 / 33 ] ) ; 16 % ( N = 7 ) experienced manic episodes , and 11 % ( N = 5 ) experienced hypomanic episodes .|Sex , age , diagnosis ( bipolar I vs . bipolar II ) , and additional treatment did not affect the risk of switching .|The incidence of mood switches seemed not to differ between patients receiving an anticonvulsant and those receiving no mood stabilizer .|In contrast , mood switches were less frequent in patients receiving lithium ( 15 % , 4 / 26 ) than in patients not treated with lithium ( 44 % , 8 / 18 ; p = . 04 ) .|The number of previous manic episodes did not affect the probability of switching , whereas a high score on the hyperthymia component of the Semistructured Affective Temperament Interview was associated with a greater risk of switching ( p = . 008 ) .|CONCLUSION : The frequency of mood switching associated with acute antidepressant therapy may be reduced by lithium treatment .|Particular attention should be paid to patients with a hyperthymic temperament , who have a greater risk of mood switches .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	0-1	3-4	D000928	Antidepressant|antidepressants|antidepressant|antidepressant|antidepressant	Chemical	0:25:127:135:390	1:26:128:136:391	0:1:3:3:9	D001714	mania|bipolar|mania|bipolar depression|bipolar disorder|manic|hypomanic|DSM - IV bipolar I|bipolar II|manic|hypomania|mania|manic|hypomanic|bipolar I|bipolar II|manic	Disease	3:5:22:38:54:87:89:108:115:122:192:194:235:247:256:260:341	4:6:23:40:56:88:90:113:117:123:193:195:236:248:258:262:342	0:0:1:1:2:3:3:3:3:3:4:4:4:4:5:5:8	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	235-236	219-220	D017367	serotonin reuptake inhibitors|SSRIs|SSRIs	Chemical	143:147:219	146:148:220	3:3:4	D001714	mania|bipolar|mania|bipolar depression|bipolar disorder|manic|hypomanic|DSM - IV bipolar I|bipolar II|manic|hypomania|mania|manic|hypomanic|bipolar I|bipolar II|manic	Disease	3:5:22:38:54:87:89:108:115:122:192:194:235:247:256:260:341	4:6:23:40:56:88:90:113:117:123:193:195:236:248:258:262:342	0:0:1:1:2:3:3:3:3:3:4:4:4:4:5:5:8	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	341-342	322-323	D008094	lithium|lithium|lithium|lithium	Chemical	158:307:322:396	159:308:323:397	3:7:7:9	D001714	mania|bipolar|mania|bipolar depression|bipolar disorder|manic|hypomanic|DSM - IV bipolar I|bipolar II|manic|hypomania|mania|manic|hypomanic|bipolar I|bipolar II|manic	Disease	3:5:22:38:54:87:89:108:115:122:192:194:235:247:256:260:341	4:6:23:40:56:88:90:113:117:123:193:195:236:248:258:262:342	0:0:1:1:2:3:3:3:3:3:4:4:4:4:5:5:8

17111419	Severe citrate toxicity complicating volunteer apheresis platelet donation .|We report a case of severe citrate toxicity during volunteer donor apheresis platelet collection .|The donor was a 40 - year - old female , first - time apheresis platelet donor .|Past medical history was remarkable for hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and depression .|Reported medications included bumetanide , pravastatin , and paroxetine .|Thirty minutes from the start of the procedure , the donor noted tingling around the mouth , hands , and feet .|She then very rapidly developed acute onset of severe facial and extremity tetany .|Empirical treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate was initiated , and muscle contractions slowly subsided over approximately 10 to 15 minutes .|The events are consistent with a severe reaction to calcium chelation by sodium citrate anticoagulant resulting in symptomatic systemic hypocalcemia .|Upon additional retrospective analysis , it was noted that bumetanide is a loop diuretic that may cause significant hypocalcemia .|We conclude that careful screening for medications and underlying conditions predisposing to hypocalcemia is recommended to help prevent severe reactions due to citrate toxicity .|Laboratory measurement of pre - procedure serum calcium levels in selected donors may identify cases requiring heightened vigilance .|The case also illustrates the importance of maintaining preparedness for managing rare but serious reactions in volunteer apheresis blood donors .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	1-2	2-3	C102006	citrate|citrate|sodium

17175308	Proteinuria after conversion to sirolimus in renal transplant recipients .|Sirolimus ( SRL ) is a new , potent immunosuppressive agent .|More recently , proteinuria has been reported as a consequence of sirolimus therapy , although the mechanism has remained unclear .|We retrospectively examined the records of 25 renal transplant patients , who developed or displayed increased proteinuria after SRL conversion .|The patient cohort ( 14 men , 11 women ) was treated with SRL as conversion therapy , due to chronic allograft nephropathy ( CAN ) ( n = 15 ) neoplasia ( n = 8 ) ; Kaposi 's sarcoma , Four skin cancers , One intestinal tumors , One renal cell carsinom ) or BK virus nephropathy ( n = 2 ) .|SRL was started at a mean of 78 + / - 42 ( 15 to 163 ) months after transplantation .|Mean follow - up on SRL therapy was 20 + / - 12 ( 6 to 43 ) months .|Proteinuria increased from 0 . 445 ( 0 to 1 . 5 ) g / d before conversion to 3 . 2 g / dL ( 0 . 2 to 12 ) after conversion ( P = 0 . 001 ) .|Before conversion 8 ( 32 % ) patients had no proteinuria , whereas afterwards all patients had proteinuria .|In 28 % of patients proteinuria remained unchanged , whereas it increased in 68 % of patients .|In 40 % it increased by more than 100 % .|Twenty - eight percent of patients showed increased proteinuria to the nephrotic range .|Biopsies performed in five patients revealed new pathological changes : One membranoproliferative glomerulopathy and interstitial nephritis .|These patients showed persistently good graft function .|Serum creatinine values did not change significantly : 1 . 98 + / - 0 . 8 mg / dL before SRL therapy and 2 . 53 + / - 1 . 9 mg / dL at last follow - up ( P = . 14 ) .|Five grafts were lost and the patients returned to dialysis .|Five patients displayed CAN and Kaposi 's sarcoma .|Mean urinary protein of patients who returned to dialysis was 1 . 26 ( 0 . 5 to 3 . 5 ) g / d before and 4 . 7 ( 3 to 12 ) g / d after conversion ( P = . 01 ) .|Mean serum creatinine level before conversion was 2 . 21 mg / dL and thereafter , 4 . 93 mg / dL ( P = . 02 ) .|Heavy proteinuria was common after the use of SRL as rescue therapy for renal transplantation .|Therefore , conversion should be considered for patients who have not developed advanced CAN and proteinuria .|The possibility of de novo glomerular pathology under SRL treatment requires further investigation by renal biopsy

17244258	In vitro characterization of parasympathetic and sympathetic responses in cyclophosphamide - induced cystitis in the rat .|In cyclophosphamide - induced cystitis in the rat , detrusor function is impaired and the expression and effects of muscarinic receptors altered .|Whether or not the neuronal transmission may be affected by cystitis was presently investigated .|Responses of urinary strip preparations from control and cyclophosphamide - pretreated rats to electrical field stimulation and to agonists were assessed in the absence and presence of muscarinic , adrenergic and purinergic receptor antagonists .|Generally , atropine reduced contractions , but in contrast to controls , it also reduced responses to low electrical field stimulation intensity ( 1 - 5 Hz ) in inflamed preparations .|In both types , purinoceptor desensitization with alpha , beta - methylene adenosine - 5 ' - triphosphate ( alpha , beta - meATP ) caused further reductions at low frequencies ( < 10 Hz ) .|The muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine , 4 - diphenylacetoxy - N - methylpiperidine ( 4 - DAMP ) ( ' M ( 1 ) / M ( 3 ) / M ( 5 ) - selective ' ) , methoctramine ( ' M ( 2 ) - selective ' ) and pirenzepine ( ' M ( 1 ) - selective ' ) antagonized the tonic component of the electrical field stimulation - evoked contractile response more potently than the phasic component .|4 - DAMP inhibited the tonic contractions in controls more potently than methoctramine and pirenzepine .|In inflamed preparations , the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation - evoked contraction was decreased and the pirenzepine and 4 - DAMP antagonism on the tonic component was much less efficient than in controls .|In contrast to controls , methoctramine increased - - instead of decreased - - the tonic responses at high frequencies .|While contractions to carbachol and ATP were the same in inflamed and in control strips when related to a reference potassium response , isoprenaline - induced relaxations were smaller in inflamed strips .|Thus , in cystitis substantial changes of the efferent functional responses occur .|While postjunctional beta - adrenoceptor - mediated relaxations are reduced , effects by prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptors may be increased .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	9-10	12-13	D003520	cyclophosphamide|cyclophosphamide|cyclophosphamide	Chemical	9:18:63	10:19:64	0:1:3	D003556	cystitis|cystitis|cystitis|cystitis	Disease	12:21:50:356	13:22:51:357	0:1:2:11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	92-93	50-51	D001285	atropine|atropine	Chemical	92:163	93:164	4:6	D003556	cystitis|cystitis|cystitis|cystitis	Disease	12:21:50:356	13:22:51:357	0:1:2:11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	129-140	50-51	C002630	alpha , beta - methylene adenosine - 5 ' - triphosphate|alpha , beta - meATP	Chemical	129:141	140:146	5:5	D003556	cystitis|cystitis|cystitis|cystitis	Disease	12:21:50:356	13:22:51:357	0:1:2:11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	356-357	283-286	C042375	4 - diphenylacetoxy - N - methylpiperidine|4 - DAMP|4 - DAMP|4 - DAMP	Chemical	165:173:241:283	172:176:244:286	6:6:7:8	D003556	cystitis|cystitis|cystitis|cystitis	Disease	12:21:50:356	13:22:51:357	0:1:2:11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	356-357	304-305	C054938	methoctramine|methoctramine|methoctramine	Chemical	198:253:304	199:254:305	6:7:9	D003556	cystitis|cystitis|cystitis|cystitis	Disease	12:21:50:356	13:22:51:357	0:1:2:11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	356-357	281-282	D010890	pirenzepine|pirenzepine|pirenzepine	Chemical	210:255:281	211:256:282	6:7:8	D003556	cystitis|cystitis|cystitis|cystitis	Disease	12:21:50:356	13:22:51:357	0:1:2:11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	356-357	323-324	D002217	carbachol	Chemical	323	324	10	D003556	cystitis|cystitis|cystitis|cystitis	Disease	12:21:50:356	13:22:51:357	0:1:2:11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	356-357	325-326	D000255	ATP	Chemical	325	326	10	D003556	cystitis|cystitis|cystitis|cystitis	Disease	12:21:50:356	13:22:51:357	0:1:2:11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	356-357	340-341	D011188	potassium	Chemical	340	341	10	D003556	cystitis|cystitis|cystitis|cystitis	Disease	12:21:50:356	13:22:51:357	0:1:2:11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	356-357	343-344	D007545	isoprenaline	Chemical	343	344	10	D003556	cystitis|cystitis|cystitis|cystitis	Disease	12:21:50:356	13:22:51:357	0:1:2:11
18020536	Associations between use of benzodiazepines or related drugs and health , physical abilities and cognitive function : a non - randomised clinical study in the elderly .|OBJECTIVE : To describe associations between the use of benzodiazepines or related drugs ( BZDs / RDs ) and health , functional abilities and cognitive function in the elderly .|METHODS : A non - randomised clinical study of patients aged > or = 65 years admitted to acute hospital wards during 1 month .|164 patients ( mean age + / - standard deviation [ SD ] 81 . 6 + / - 6 . 8 years ) were admitted .|Of these , nearly half ( n = 78 ) had used BZDs / RDs before admission , and the remainder ( n = 86 ) were non - users .|Cognitive ability was assessed by the Mini - Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) .|Patients scoring > or = 20 MMSE sum points were interviewed ( n = 79 ) and questioned regarding symptoms and functional abilities during the week prior to admission .|Data on use of BZDs / RDs before admission , current medications and discharge diagnoses were collected from medical records .|Health , physical abilities and cognitive function were compared between BZD / RD users and non - users , and adjustments were made for confounding variables .|The residual serum concentrations of oxazepam , temazepam and zopiclone were analysed .|RESULTS : The mean + / - SD duration of BZD / RD use was 7 + / - 7 years ( range 1 - 31 ) .|Two or three BZDs / RDs were concomitantly taken by 26 % of users ( n = 20 ) .|Long - term use of these drugs was associated with female sex and use of a higher number of drugs with effects on the CNS , which tended to be related to diagnosed dementia .|After adjustment for these variables as confounders , use of BZDs / RDs was not associated with cognitive function as measured by the MMSE .|However , use of BZDs / RDs was associated with dizziness , inability to sleep after awaking at night and tiredness in the mornings during the week prior to admission and with stronger depressive symptoms measured at the beginning of the hospital stay .|Use of BZDs / RDs tended to be associated with a reduced ability to walk and shorter night - time sleep during the week prior to admission .|A higher residual serum concentration of temazepam correlated with a lower MMSE sum score after adjustment for confounding variables .|CONCLUSIONS : Long -

atherosclerotic rats are lacking .|The aim of this study is to examine the role of gastric acid back - diffusion , mast cell histamine release , lipid peroxide ( LPO ) generation and mucosal microvascular permeability in modulating gastric hemorrhage and ulcer in rats with atherosclerosis induced by coadministration of vitamin D2 and cholesterol .|Additionally , the protective effect of verapamil on this ulcer model was evaluated .|Male Wistar rats were challenged intragastrically once daily for 9 days with 1 . 0 ml / kg of corn oil containing vitamin D2 and cholesterol to induce atherosclerosis .|Control rats received corn oil only .|After gastric surgery , rat stomachs were irrigated for 3 h with either simulated gastric juice or normal saline .|Gastric acid back - diffusion , mucosal LPO generation , histamine concentration , microvascular permeability , luminal hemoglobin content and ulcer areas were determined .|Elevated atherosclerotic parameters , such as serum calcium , total cholesterol and low - density lipoprotein concentration were obtained in atherosclerotic rats .|Severe gastric ulcers accompanied with increased ulcerogenic factors , including gastric acid back - diffusion , histamine release , LPO generation and luminal hemoglobin content were also observed in these rats .|Moreover , a positive correlation of histamine to gastric hemorrhage and to ulcer was found in those atherosclerotic rats .|This hemorrhagic ulcer and various ulcerogenic parameters were dose - dependently ameliorated by daily intragastric verapamil .|Atherosclerosis could produce gastric hemorrhagic ulcer via aggravation of gastric acid back - diffusion , LPO generation , histamine release and microvascular permeability that could be ameliorated by verapamil in rats

20003049	Prolonged elevation of plasma argatroban in a cardiac transplant patient with a suspected history of heparin - induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis .|BACKGROUND : Direct thrombin inhibitors ( DTIs ) provide an alternative method of anticoagulation for patients with a history of heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) or HIT with thrombosis ( HITT ) undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) .|In the following report , a 65 - year - old critically ill patient with a suspected history of HITT was administered argatroban for anticoagulation on bypass during heart transplantation .|The patient required massive transfusion support ( 55 units of red blood cells , 42 units of fresh - frozen plasma , 40 units of cryoprecipitate , 40 units of platelets , and three doses of recombinant Factor VIIa ) for severe intraoperative and postoperative bleeding .|STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS : Plasma samples from before and after CPB were analyzed postoperatively for argatroban concentration using a modified ecarin clotting time ( ECT ) assay .|RESULTS : Unexpectedly high concentrations of argatroban were measured in these samples ( range , 0 - 32 microg / mL ) , and a prolonged plasma argatroban half life ( t ( 1 / 2 ) ) of 514 minutes was observed ( published elimination t ( 1 / 2 ) is 39 - 51 minutes [ < or = 181 minutes with hepatic impairment ] ) .|CONCLUSIONS : Correlation of plasma argatroban concentration versus the patient 's coagulation variables and clinical course suggest that prolonged elevated levels of plasma argatroban may have contributed to the patient 's extended coagulopathy .|Because DTIs do not have reversal agents , surgical teams and transfusion services should remain aware of the possibility of massive transfusion events during anticoagulation with these agents .|This is the first report to measure plasma argatroban concentration in the context of CPB and extended coagulopathy .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	82-83	85-86	C031942	argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban	Chemical	4:85:157:176:197:244:262:310	5:86:158:177:198:245:263:311	0:2:4:5:5:6:6:8	D013921	thrombocytopenia|thrombocytopenia|HIT|HIT|HITT|HITT	Disease	18:45:47:50:54:82	19:46:48:51:55:83	0:1:1:1:1:2	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	82-83	85-86	C031942	argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban	Chemical	4:85:157:176:197:244:262:310	5:86:158:177:198:245:263:311	0:2:4:5:5:6:6:8	D013927	thrombosis|thrombosis|HITT|HITT	Disease	20:52:54:82	21:53:55:83	0:1:1:2	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	74-76	85-86	C031942	argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban	Chemical	4:85:157:176:197:244:262:310	5:86:158:177:198:245:263:311	0:2:4:5:5:6:6:8	D016638	critically ill	Disease	74	76	2	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	136-140	157-158	C031942	argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban	Chemical	4:85:157:176:197:244:262:310	5:86:158:177:198:245:263:311	0:2:4:5:5:6:6:8	D016063	intraoperative and postoperative bleeding	Disease	136	140	3	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	136-140	157-158	C031942	argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban	Chemical	4:85:157:176:197:244:262:310	5:86:158:177:198:245:263:311	0:2:4:5:5:6:6:8	D019106	intraoperative and postoperative bleeding	Disease	136	140	3	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	234-236	244-245	C031942	argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban	Chemical	4:85:157:176:197:244:262:310	5:86:158:177:198:245:263:311	0:2:4:5:5:6:6:8	D008107	hepatic impairment	Disease	234	236	5	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	262-263	271-272	C031942	argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban|argatroban	Chemical	4:85:157:176:197:244:262:310	5:86:158:177:198:245:263:311	0:2:4:5:5:6:6:8	D001778	coagulopathy|coagulopathy	Disease	271:319	272:320	6:8	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	15-16	18-19	D006493	heparin|heparin	Chemical	15:42	16:43	0:1	D013921	thrombocytopenia|thrombocytopenia|HIT|HIT|HITT|HITT	Disease	18:45:47:50:54:82	19:46:48:51:55:83	0:1:1:1:1:2	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	15-16	20-21	D006493	heparin|heparin	Chemical	15:42	16:43	0:1	D013927	thrombosis|thrombosis|HITT|HITT	Disease	20:52:54:82	21:53:55:83	0:1:1:2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	42-43	74-76	D006493	heparin|heparin	Chemical	15:42	16:43	0:1	D016638	critically ill	Disease	74	76	2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	42-43	136-140	D006493	heparin|heparin	Chemical	15:42	16:43	0:1	D016063	intraoperative and postoperative bleeding	Disease	136	140	3	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	42-43	136-140	D006493	heparin|heparin	Chemical	15:42	16:43	0:1	D019106	intraoperative and postoperative bleeding	Disease	136	140	3	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	42-43	234-236	D006493	heparin|heparin	Chemical	15:42	16:43	0:1	D008107	hepatic impairment	Disease	234	236	5	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	42-43	271-272	D006493	heparin|heparin	Chemical	15:42	16:43	0:1	D001778	coagulopathy|coagulopathy	Disease	271:319	272:320	6:8

9855119	Clinical and histopathologic examination of renal allografts treated with tacrolimus ( FK506 ) for at least one year .|BACKGROUND : We clinically and pathologically analyzed renal allografts from 1 9 renal transplant patients treated with tacrolimus ( FK506 ) for more than 1 year .|METHODS : Twenty - six renal allograft biopsy specimens from 1 9 renal transplant patients who underwent transplantations between 1991 and 1993 were evaluated .|Thirteen biopsies were performed from stable functioning renal allografts with informed consent ( nonepisode biopsy ) and the other 13 were from dysfunctional renal allografts with a clinical indication for biopsy ( episode biopsy ) .|RESULTS : The main pathologic diagnoses ( some overlap ) were acute rejection ( AR ; n = 4 ) , chronic rejection ( CR ; n = 5 ) , AR + CR ( n = 4 ) , recurrent IgA nephropathy ( n = 5 ) , normal findings ( n = 2 ) , minimal - type chronic FK506 nephropathy ( n = 9 ) , and mild - type FK506 nephropathy ( n = 11 ) .|Of the nonepisode biopsies , 7 and 4 biopsies showed minimal - type and mild - type chronic FK506 nephropathy , respectively .|Chronic FK506 nephropathy consisted of rough and foamy tubular vacuolization ( 5 biopsies ) , arteriolopathy ( angiodegeneration of the arteriolar wall ; 20 biopsies ) , focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( 4 biopsies ) and the striped form of interstitial fibrosis ( 11 biopsies ) .|The serum creatinine levels of patients in the mild - type chronic FK506 nephropathy group , which included 7 episode biopsies , were statistically higher than those in the minimum - type chronic FK506 - nephropathy group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .|CONCLUSIONS : This study demonstrates that chronic FK506 nephropathy consists primarily of arteriolopathy manifesting as insudative hyalinosis of the arteriolar wall , and suggests that mild - type chronic FK506 nephropathy is a condition which may lead to deterioration of renal allograft function .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	148-150	168-169	D016559	tacrolimus|FK506|tacrolimus|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506	Chemical	9:11:36:38:168:180:206:212:269:290:309:331	10:12:37:39:169:181:207:213:270:291:310:332	0:0:1:1:4:4:5:6:7:7:8:8	D005922	IgA nephropathy	Disease	148	150	4	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	168-169	169-170	D016559	tacrolimus|FK506|tacrolimus|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506	Chemical	9:11:36:38:168:180:206:212:269:290:309:331	10:12:37:39:169:181:207:213:270:291:310:332	0:0:1:1:4:4:5:6:7:7:8:8	D007674	nephropathy|nephropathy|nephropathy|nephropathy|nephropathy|nephropathy|nephropathy|nephropathy	Disease	169:181:207:213:270:292:310:332	170:182:208:214:271:293:311:333	4:4:5:6:7:7:8:8	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	212-213	238-241	D016559	tacrolimus|FK506|tacrolimus|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506	Chemical	9:11:36:38:168:180:206:212:269:290:309:331	10:12:37:39:169:181:207:213:270:291:310:332	0:0:1:1:4:4:5:6:7:7:8:8	D005923	focal segmental glomerulosclerosis	Disease	238	241	6	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	250-252	269-270	D016559	tacrolimus|FK506|tacrolimus|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506	Chemical	9:11:36:38:168:180:206:212:269:290:309:331	10:12:37:39:169:181:207:213:270:291:310:332	0:0:1:1:4:4:5:6:7:7:8:8	D005355	interstitial fibrosis	Disease	250	252	6	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	259-260	148-150	D003404	creatinine	Chemical	259	260	7	D005922	IgA nephropathy	Disease	148	150	4	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	270-271	259-260	D003404	creatinine	Chemical	259	260	7	D007674	nephropathy|nephropathy|nephropathy|nephropathy|nephropathy|nephropathy|nephropathy|nephropathy	Disease	169:181:207:213:270:292:310:332	170:182:208:214:271:293:311:333	4:4:5:6:7:7:8:8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	259-260	238-241	D003404	creatinine	Chemical	259	260	7	D005923	focal segmental glomerulosclerosis	Disease	238	241	6	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	259-260	250-252	D003404	creatinine	Chemical	259	260	7	D005355	interstitial fibrosis	Disease	250	252	6

hippocampal cholinergic pathway has been implicated in epileptogenesis , and genetic factors influence the response to cholinergic agents , but limited data are available on cholinergic involvement in alcohol withdrawal severity .|Thus , the relationship between cholinergic activity and responsiveness and alcohol withdrawal was investigated in a genetic animal model of ethanol withdrawal severity .|METHODS : Cholinergic convulsant sensitivity was examined in alcohol - na ve Withdrawal Seizure - Prone ( WSP ) and - Resistant ( WSR ) mice .|Animals were administered nicotine , carbachol , or neostigmine via timed tail vein infusion , and the latencies to onset of tremor and clonus were recorded and converted to threshold dose .|We also used microdialysis to measure basal and potassium - stimulated acetylcholine ( ACh ) release in the CA1 region of the hippocampus .|Potassium was applied by reverse dialysis twice , separated by 75 min .|Hippocampal ACh also was measured during testing for handling - induced convulsions .|RESULTS : Sensitivity to several convulsion endpoints induced by nicotine , carbachol , and neostigmine were significantly greater in WSR versus WSP mice .|In microdialysis experiments , the lines did not differ in basal release of ACh , and 50 mM KCl increased ACh output in both lines of mice .|However , the increase in release of ACh produced by the first application of KCl was 2 - fold higher in WSP versus WSR mice .|When hippocampal ACh was measured during testing for handling - induced convulsions , extracellular ACh was significantly elevated ( 192 % ) in WSP mice , but was nonsignificantly elevated ( 59 % ) in WSR mice .|CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that differences in cholinergic activity and postsynaptic sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants may be associated with ethanol withdrawal severity and implicate cholinergic mechanisms in alcohol withdrawal .|Specifically , WSP mice may have lower sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants compared with WSR because of postsynaptic receptor desensitization brought on by higher activity of cholinergic neurons .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	283-284	286-287	D000109	acetylcholine|acetylcholine|ACh|ACh|ACh|ACh|ACh|ACh|ACh	Chemical	4:155:157:182:231:238:253:274:286	5:156:158:183:232:239:254:275:287	0:5:5:7:9:9:10:11:11	D012640	seizure|seizure|Seizure|convulsions|convulsion|convulsions|convulsants|convulsants	Disease	12:17:98:192:199:283:325:351	13:18:99:193:200:284:326:352	0:0:3:7:8:11:12:13	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	133-134	155-156	D000109	acetylcholine|acetylcholine|ACh|ACh|ACh|ACh|ACh|ACh|ACh	Chemical	4:155:157:182:231:238:253:274:286	5:156:158:183:232:239:254:275:287	0:5:5:7:9:9:10:11:11	D014202	tremor	Disease	133	134	4	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	98-99	93-94	D000431	alcohol|alcohol|ethanol|alcohol|ethanol|alcohol	Chemical	57:71:81:93:330:338	58:72:82:94:331:339	1:2:2:3:12:12	D012640	seizure|seizure|Seizure|convulsions|convulsion|convulsions|convulsants|convulsants	Disease	12:17:98:192:199:283:325:351	13:18:99:193:200:284:326:352	0:0:3:7:8:11:12:13	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	203-204	199-200	D009538	nicotine|nicotine	Chemical	115:203	116:204	4:8	D012640	seizure|seizure|Seizure|convulsions|convulsion|convulsions|convulsants|convulsants	Disease	12:17:98:192:199:283:325:351	13:18:99:193:200:284:326:352	0:0:3:7:8:11:12:13	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	205-206	199-200	D002217	carbachol|carbachol	Chemical	117:205	118:206	4:8	D012640	seizure|seizure|Seizure|convulsions|convulsion|convulsions|convulsants|convulsants	Disease	12:17:98:192:199:283:325:351	13:18:99:193:200:284:326:352	0:0:3:7:8:11:12:13	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	208-209	199-200	D009388	neostigmine|neostigmine	Chemical	120:208	121:209	4:8	D012640	seizure|seizure|Seizure|convulsions|convulsion|convulsions|convulsants|convulsants	Disease	12:17:98:192:199:283:325:351	13:18:99:193:200:284:326:352	0:0:3:7:8:11:12:13	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	192-193	168-169	D011188	potassium|Potassium	Chemical	152:168	153:169	5:6	D012640	seizure|seizure|Seizure|convulsions|convulsion|convulsions|convulsants|convulsants	Disease	12:17:98:192:199:283:325:351	13:18:99:193:200:284:326:352	0:0:3:7:8:11:12:13	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	283-284	260-261	C522374	KCl|KCl	Chemical	236:260	237:261	9:10	D012640	seizure|seizure|Seizure|convulsions|convulsion|convulsions|convulsants|convulsants	Disease	12:17:98:192:199:283:325:351	13:18:99:193:200:284:326:352	0:0:3:7:8:11:12:13	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	93-94	133-134	D000431	alcohol|alcohol|ethanol|alcohol|ethanol|alcohol	Chemical	57:71:81:93:330:338	58:72:82:94:331:339	1:2:2:3:12:12	D014202	tremor	Disease	133	134	4	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	115-116	133-134	D009538	nicotine|nicotine	Chemical	115:203	116:204	4:8	D014202	tremor	Disease	133	134	4	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	117-118	133-134	D002217	carbachol|carbachol	Chemical	117:205	118:206	4:8	D014202	tremor	Disease	133	134	4	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	120-121	133-134	D009388	neostigmine|neostigmine	Chemical	120:208	121:209	4:8	D014202	tremor	Disease	133	134	4	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	152-153	133-134	D011188	potassium|Potassium	Chemical	152:168	153:169	5:6	D014202	tremor	Disease	133	134	4	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	236-237	133-134	C522374	KCl|KCl	Chemical	236:260	237:261	9:10	D014202	tremor	Disease	133	134	4

15145918	Differential modulation by estrogen of alpha2 - adrenergic and I1 - imidazoline receptor - mediated hypotension in female rats .|We have recently shown that estrogen negatively modulates the hypotensive effect of clonidine ( mixed alpha2 - / I1 - receptor agonist ) in female rats and implicates the cardiovascular autonomic control in this interaction .|The present study investigated whether this effect of estrogen involves interaction with alpha2 - and / or I1 - receptors .|Changes evoked by a single intraperitoneal injection of rilmenidine ( 600 microg / kg ) or alpha - methyldopa ( 100 mg / kg ) , selective I1 - and alpha2 - receptor agonists , respectively , in blood pressure , hemodynamic variability , and locomotor activity were assessed in radiotelemetered sham - operated and ovariectomized ( Ovx ) Sprague - Dawley female rats with or without 12 - wk estrogen replacement .|Three time domain indexes of hemodynamic variability were employed : the standard deviation of mean arterial pressure as a measure of blood pressure variability and the standard deviation of beat - to - beat intervals ( SDRR ) and the root mean square of successive differences in R - wave - to - R - wave intervals as measures of heart rate variability .|In sham - operated rats , rilmenidine or alpha - methyldopa elicited similar hypotension that lasted at least 5 h and was associated with reductions in standard deviation of mean arterial pressure .|SDRR was reduced only by alpha - methyldopa .|Ovx significantly enhanced the hypotensive response to alpha - methyldopa , in contrast to no effect on rilmenidine hypotension .|The enhanced alpha - methyldopa hypotension in Ovx rats was paralleled with further reduction in SDRR and a reduced locomotor activity .|Estrogen replacement ( 17beta - estradiol subcutaneous pellet , 14 . 2 microg / day , 12 wk ) of Ovx rats restored the hemodynamic and locomotor effects of alpha - methyldopa to sham - operated levels .|These findings suggest that estrogen downregulates alpha2 - but not I1 - receptor - mediated hypotension and highlight a role for the cardiac autonomic control in alpha - methyldopa - estrogen interaction .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	25-26	29-30	D004967	estrogen|estrogen|estrogen|estrogen|estrogen|estrogen	Chemical	3:25:64:147:340:366	4:26:65:148:341:367	0:1:2:3:10:10	D007022	hypotension|hypotensive|hypotension|hypotensive|hypotension|hypotension|hypotension	Disease	15:29:227:260:274:281:351	16:30:228:261:275:282:352	0:1:5:7:7:8:10	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	293-297	340-341	D004967	estrogen|estrogen|estrogen|estrogen|estrogen|estrogen	Chemical	3:25:64:147:340:366	4:26:65:148:341:367	0:1:2:3:10:10	D001523	a reduced locomotor activity	Disease	293	297	8	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	11-12	15-16	D048288	imidazoline	Chemical	11	12	0	D007022	hypotension|hypotensive|hypotension|hypotensive|hypotension|hypotension|hypotension	Disease	15:29:227:260:274:281:351	16:30:228:261:275:282:352	0:1:5:7:7:8:10	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	11-12	293-297	D048288	imidazoline	Chemical	11	12	0	D001523	a reduced locomotor activity	Disease	293	297	8	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	32-33	29-30	D003000	clonidine	Chemical	32	33	1	D007022	hypotension|hypotensive|hypotension|hypotensive|hypotension|hypotension|hypotension	Disease	15:29:227:260:274:281:351	16:30:228:261:275:282:352	0:1:5:7:7:8:10	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	274-275	273-274	C032302	rilmenidine|rilmenidine|rilmenidine	Chemical	85:220:273	86:221:274	3:5:7	D007022	hypotension|hypotensive|hypotension|hypotensive|hypotension|hypotension|hypotension	Disease	15:29:227:260:274:281:351	16:30:228:261:275:282:352	0:1:5:7:7:8:10	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	281-282	278-281	D008750	alpha -

renal dysfunction .|A common risk factor appears to be presence of pre - existing chronic renal damage .|The mechanisms of sirolimus - associated proteinuria are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal .|It has also been suggested that sirolimus directly causes increased glomerular permeability / injury , but evidence for this mechanism is currently inconclusive .|The acute renal dysfunction associated with sirolimus ( such as in delayed graft function ) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival / repair processes .|Although these adverse effects occur in some patients , their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of sirolimus on the kidney , the use of sirolimus in appropriate patient populations , close monitoring of proteinuria and renal function , use of angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers if proteinuria occurs and withdrawal if needed .|Further long - term analysis of renal allograft studies using sirolimus as de novo immunosuppression along with clinical and laboratory studies will refine these issues in the future

19759529	The glycine transporter - 1 inhibitor SSR103800 displays a selective and specific antipsychotic - like profile in normal and transgenic mice .|Schizophrenia has been initially associated with dysfunction in dopamine neurotransmission .|However , the observation that antagonists of the glutamate N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor produce schizophrenic - like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of a dysfunctioning of the glutamatergic system via its NMDA receptor .|As a result , there is a growing interest in the development of pharmacological agents with potential antipsychotic properties that enhance the activity of the glutamatergic system via a modulation of the NMDA receptor .|Among them are glycine transporter - 1 ( GlyT1 ) inhibitors such as SSR103800 , which indirectly enhance NMDA receptor function by increasing the glycine ( a co - agonist for the NMDA receptor ) levels in the synapse .|This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic - like properties of SSR103800 , with a particular focus on models of hyperactivity , involving either drug challenge ( ie , amphetamine and MK - 801 ) or transgenic mice ( ie , NMDA Nr1 ( neo - / - ) and DAT ( - / - ) ) .|Results showed that SSR103800 ( 10 - 30 mg / kg p . o . ) blocked hyperactivity induced by the non - competitive NMDA receptor antagonist , MK - 801 and partially reversed spontaneous hyperactivity of NMDA Nr1 ( neo - / - ) mice .|In contrast , SSR103800 failed to affect hyperactivity induced by amphetamine or naturally observed in dopamine transporter ( DAT ( - / - ) ) knockout mice ( 10 - 30 mg / kg p . o . ) .|Importantly , both classical ( haloperidol ) and atypical ( olanzapine , clozapine and aripiprazole ) antipsychotics were effective in all these models of hyperactivity .|However , unlike these latter , SSR103800 did not produce catalepsy ( retention on the bar test ) up to 30 mg / kg p . o .|Together these findings show that the GlyT1 inhibitor , SSR103800 , produces antipsychotic - like effects , which differ from those observed with compounds primarily targeting the dopaminergic system , and has a reduced side - effect potential as compared with these latter drugs .	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	1-2	22-23	D005998	glycine|glycine|glycine	Chemical	1:115:136	2:116:137	0:4:4	D012559	Schizophrenia|schizophrenic	Disease	22:54	23:55	1:2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	136-137	173-174	D005998	glycine|glycine|glycine	Chemical	1:115:136	2:116:137	0:4:4	D006948	hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity	Disease	173:228:246:265:322	174:229:247:266:323	5:6:6:7:8	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	136-137	334-335	D005998	glycine|glycine|glycine	Chemical	1:115:136	2:116:137	0:4:4	D002375	catalepsy	Disease	334	335	9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	30-31	22-23	D004298	dopamine|dopamine	Chemical	30:273	31:274	1:7	D012559	Schizophrenia|schizophrenic	Disease	22:54	23:55	1:2	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	54-55	41-42	D018698	glutamate	Chemical	41	42	2	D012559	Schizophrenia|schizophrenic	Disease	22:54	23:55	1:2	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	54-55	50-51	D016202	N -

20619828	A novel , multiple symptom model of obsessive - compulsive - like behaviors in animals .|BACKGROUND : Current animal models of obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) typically involve acute , drug - induced symptom provocation or a genetic association with stereotypies or anxiety .|None of these current models demonstrate multiple OCD - like behaviors .|METHODS : Neonatal rats were treated with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine or vehicle between days 9 and 16 twice daily and behaviorally tested in adulthood .|RESULTS : Clomipramine exposure in immature rats produced significant behavioral and biochemical changes that include enhanced anxiety ( elevated plus maze and marble burying ) , behavioral inflexibility ( perseveration in the spontaneous alternation task and impaired reversal learning ) , working memory impairment ( e . g . , win - shift paradigm ) , hoarding , and corticostriatal dysfunction .|Dopamine D2 receptors were elevated in the striatum , whereas serotonin 2C , but not serotonin 1A , receptors were elevated in the orbital frontal cortex .|CONCLUSIONS : This is the first demonstration of multiple symptoms consistent with an OCD - like profile in animals .|Moreover , these behaviors are accompanied by biochemical changes in brain regions previously identified as relevant to OCD .|This novel model of OCD demonstrates that drug exposure during a sensitive period can program disease - like systems permanently , which could have implications for current and future therapeutic strategies for this and other psychiatric disorders .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	68-69	54-55	D000928	antidepressant	Chemical	68	69	3	D009771	obsessive - compulsive - like behaviors|obsessive - compulsive disorder|OCD|OCD|OCD|OCD|OCD	Disease	7:22:27:54:187:211:217	13:26:28:55:188:212:218	0:1:1:2:6:7:8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	69-70	54-55	D002997	clomipramine|Clomipramine	Chemical	69:87	70:88	3:4	D009771	obsessive - compulsive - like behaviors|obsessive - compulsive disorder|OCD|OCD|OCD|OCD|OCD	Disease	7:22:27:54:187:211:217	13:26:28:55:188:212:218	0:1:1:2:6:7:8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	187-188	147-148	D004298	Dopamine	Chemical	147	148	5	D009771	obsessive - compulsive - like behaviors|obsessive - compulsive disorder|OCD|OCD|OCD|OCD|OCD	Disease	7:22:27:54:187:211:217	13:26:28:55:188:212:218	0:1:1:2:6:7:8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	187-188	162-163	D012701	serotonin|serotonin	Chemical	157:162	158:163	5:5	D009771	obsessive - compulsive - like behaviors|obsessive - compulsive disorder|OCD|OCD|OCD|OCD|OCD	Disease	7:22:27:54:187:211:217	13:26:28:55:188:212:218	0:1:1:2:6:7:8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	68-69	45-46	D000928	antidepressant	Chemical	68	69	3	D001008	anxiety|anxiety	Disease	45:101	46:102	1:4	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	101-102	87-88	D002997	clomipramine|Clomipramine	Chemical	69:87	70:88	3:4	D001008	anxiety|anxiety	Disease	45:101	46:102	1:4	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	147-148	101-102	D004298	Dopamine	Chemical	147	148	5	D001008	anxiety|anxiety	Disease	45:101	46:102	1:4	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	157-158	101-102	D012701	serotonin|serotonin	Chemical	157:162	158:163	5:5	D001008	anxiety|anxiety	Disease	45:101	46:102	1:4	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	68-69	127-129	D000928	antidepressant	Chemical	68	69	3	D008569	memory impairment	Disease	127	129	4	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	68-69	141-142	D000928	antidepressant	Chemical	68	69	3	D060845	hoarding	Disease	141	142	4	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	68-69	248-250	D000928	antidepressant	Chemical	68	69	3	D001523	psychiatric disorders	Disease	248	250	8	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	87-88	127-129	D002997	clomipramine|Clomipramine	Chemical	69:87	70:88	3:4	D008569	memory impairment	Disease	127	129	4	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	87-88	141-142	D002997	clomipramine|Clomipramine	Chemical	69:87	70:88	3:4	D060845	hoarding	Disease	141	142	4	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	87-88	248-250	D002997	clomipramine|Clomipramine	Chemical	69:87	70:88	3:4	D001523	psychiatric disorders	Disease	248	250	8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	147-148	127-129	D004298	Dopamine	Chemical	147	148	5	D008569	memory impairment	Disease	127	129	4	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	157-158	127-129	D012701	serotonin|serotonin	Chemical	157:162	158:163	5:5	D008569	memory impairment	Disease	127	129	4	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	147-148	141-142	D004298	Dopamine	Chemical	147	148	5	D060845	hoarding	Disease	141	142	4	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	157-158	141-142	D012701	serotonin|serotonin	Chemical	157:162	158:163	5:5	D060845	hoarding	Disease	141	142	4	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	147-148	248-250	D004298	Dopamine	Chemical	147	148	5	D001523	psychiatric disorders	Disease	248	250	8	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	162-163	248-250	D012701	serotonin|serotonin	Chemical	157:162	158:163	5:5	D001523	psychiatric disorders	Disease	248	250	8

dactinomycin [ IVA ] ) .|None of them had received cisplatin chemotherapy .|Ages ranged from 4 months to 17 years ; 58 patients were males and 42 females .|The most common primary tumor site was the head and neck .|Renal function was investigated by measuring plasma and urinary electrolytes , glucosuria , proteinuria , aminoaciduria , urinary pH , osmolarity , creatinine clearance , phosphate tubular reabsorption , beta 2 microglobulinuria , and lysozymuria .|Fifty - eight patients ( 78 % ) had normal renal tests , whereas 16 patients ( 22 % ) had renal abnormalities .|Two subsets of patients were identified from this latter group : the first included four patients ( 5 % of the total population ) who developed major toxicity resulting in Fanconi 's syndrome ( TDFS ) ; and the second group included five patients with elevated beta 2 microglobulinuria and low phosphate reabsorption .|The remaining seven patients had isolated beta 2 microglobulinuria .|Severe toxicity was correlated with the higher cumulative dose of 60 g / m2 of ifosfamide , a younger age ( less than 2 1 / 2 years old ) , and a predominance of vesicoprostatic tumor involvement .|This low percentage ( 5 % ) of TDFS must be evaluated with respect to the efficacy of ifosfamide in the treatment of mesenchymal tumors in children

1833784	Evidence for an involvement of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine - induced hyperactivity in rats .|Previous studies have suggested that repeated exposure of rats to the drug or to the experimental environment is necessary to observe nicotine - induced locomotor stimulation .|In the present study the role of habituation to the experimental environment on the stimulant effect of nicotine in rats was examined .|In addition , the role of dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine - induced locomotor stimulation was investigated by examining the effects of selective D1 and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists on activity induced by nicotine .|Locomotor activity was assessed in male Sprague - Dawley rats tested in photocell cages .|Nicotine ( 1 . 0 mg / kg ) caused a significant increase in locomotor activity in rats that were habituated to the test environment , but had only a weak and delayed stimulant action in rats that were unfamiliar with the test environment .|The stimulant action of nicotine was blocked by the central nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine but not by the peripheral nicotinic blocker hexamethonium , indicating that the response is probably mediated by central nicotinic receptors .|Nicotine - induced hyperactivity was blocked by the selective D1 antagonist SCH 23390 , the selective D2 antagonist raclopride and the D1 / D2 antagonist fluphenazine .|Pretreatment with the D2 agonist PHNO enhanced nicotine - induced hyperactivity , whereas the D1 agonist SKF 38393 had no effect .|The results indicate that acute nicotine injection induces a pronounced hyperactivity in rats habituated to the test environment .|The effect appears to be mediated by central nicotine receptors , possibly located on dopaminergic neurons , and also requires the activation of both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	8-9	15-16	D004298	dopamine|dopamine|dopamine|dopamine	Chemical	8:75:95:293	9:76:96:294	0:3:3:10	D006948	hyperactivity|increase in locomotor activity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity	Disease	15:131:201:235:257	16:135:202:236:258	0:5:7:8:9	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	12-13	15-16	D009538	nicotine|nicotine|nicotine|nicotine|nicotine|Nicotine|nicotine|Nicotine|nicotine|nicotine|nicotine	Chemical	12:40:63:79:102:119:168:198:232:252:274	13:41:64:80:103:120:169:199:233:253:275	0:1:2:3:3:5:6:7:8:9:10	D006948	hyperactivity|increase in locomotor activity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity	Disease	15:131:201:235:257	16:135:202:236:258	0:5:7:8:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	201-202	176-177	D008464	mecamylamine	Chemical	176	177	6	D006948	hyperactivity|increase in locomotor activity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity	Disease	15:131:201:235:257	16:135:202:236:258	0:5:7:8:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	201-202	184-185	D018738	hexamethonium	Chemical	184	185	6	D006948	hyperactivity|increase in locomotor activity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity	Disease	15:131:201:235:257	16:135:202:236:258	0:5:7:8:9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	209-211	201-202	C534628	SCH 23390	Chemical	209	211	7	D006948	hyperactivity|increase in locomotor activity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity	Disease	15:131:201:235:257	16:135:202:236:258	0:5:7:8:9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	216-217	201-202	D020891	raclopride	Chemical	216	217	7	D006948	hyperactivity|increase in locomotor activity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity	Disease	15:131:201:235:257	16:135:202:236:258	0:5:7:8:9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	235-236	223-224	D005476	fluphenazine	Chemical	223	224	7	D006948	hyperactivity|increase in locomotor activity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity	Disease	15:131:201:235:257	16:135:202:236:258	0:5:7:8:9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	241-243	235-236	D015647	SKF 38393	Chemical	241	243	8	D006948	hyperactivity|increase in locomotor activity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity	Disease	15:131:201:235:257	16:135:202:236:258	0:5:7:8:9

and - effect relation between deferoxamine administration and ototoxicity .|Based on these data , a plan of management was developed that allows effective yet safe administration of deferoxamine .|A dose of 50 mg / kg is recommended in those without audiogram abnormalities .|With mild toxicity , a reduction to 30 or 40 mg / kg per dose should result in a reversal of the abnormal results to normal within four weeks .|Moderate abnormalities require a reduction of deferoxamine to 25 mg / kg per dose with careful monitoring .|In those with symptoms of hearing loss , the drug should be stopped for four weeks , and when the audiogram is stable or improved , therapy should be restarted at 10 to 25 mg / kg per dose .|Serial audiograms should be performed every six months in those without problems and more frequently in young patients with normal serum ferritin values and in those with auditory dysfunction .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	227-228	224-225	D003676	deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine	Chemical	8:37:80:142:208:224:247:300	9:38:81:143:209:225:248:301	0:1:3:5:6:6:7:10	D006311	auditory neurotoxicity|Visual and auditory neurotoxicity|auditory abnormality|ototoxicity|auditory dysfunction	Disease	3:11:178:227:379	5:15:180:228:381	0:1:5:6:12	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	31-32	11-15	D007501	iron	Chemical	31	32	1	D006311	auditory neurotoxicity|Visual and auditory neurotoxicity|auditory abnormality|ototoxicity|auditory dysfunction	Disease	3:11:178:227:379	5:15:180:228:381	0:1:5:6:12	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	8-9	11-15	D003676	deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine	Chemical	8:37:80:142:208:224:247:300	9:38:81:143:209:225:248:301	0:1:3:5:6:6:7:10	D014786	Visual and auditory neurotoxicity	Disease	11	15	1	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	27-28	37-38	D003676	deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine	Chemical	8:37:80:142:208:224:247:300	9:38:81:143:209:225:248:301	0:1:3:5:6:6:7:10	D000740	anemia	Disease	27	28	1	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	37-38	48-67	D003676	deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine	Chemical	8:37:80:142:208:224:247:300	9:38:81:143:209:225:248:301	0:1:3:5:6:6:7:10	D006316	abnormal audiograms with deficits mostly in the high frequency range of 4 , 000 to 8 , 000 Hz	Disease	48	67	2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	130-132	142-143	D003676	deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine	Chemical	8:37:80:142:208:224:247:300	9:38:81:143:209:225:248:301	0:1:3:5:6:6:7:10	D003638	permanent disability	Disease	130	132	4	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	190-191	208-209	D003676	deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine	Chemical	8:37:80:142:208:224:247:300	9:38:81:143:209:225:248:301	0:1:3:5:6:6:7:10	D064420	toxicity|toxicity	Disease	190:266	191:267	5:9	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	300-301	317-319	D003676	deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine|deferoxamine	Chemical	8:37:80:142:208:224:247:300	9:38:81:143:209:225:248:301	0:1:3:5:6:6:7:10	D034381	hearing loss	Disease	317	319	11	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	31-32	11-15	D007501	iron	Chemical	31	32	1	D014786	Visual and auditory neurotoxicity	Disease	11	15	1	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	31-32	27-28	D007501	iron	Chemical	31	32	1	D000740	anemia	Disease	27	28	1	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	31-32	48-67	D007501	iron	Chemical	31	32	1	D006316	abnormal audiograms with deficits mostly in the high frequency range of 4 , 000 to 8 , 000 Hz	Disease	48	67	2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	31-32	130-132	D007501	iron	Chemical	31	32	1	D003638	permanent disability	Disease	130	132	4	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	31-32	190-191	D007501	iron	Chemical	31	32	1	D064420	toxicity|toxicity	Disease	190:266	191:267	5:9	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	31-32	317-319	D007501	iron	Chemical	31	32	1	D034381	hearing loss	Disease	317	319	11

depleting chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) .|Limited studies in animals indicate potential hepatotoxicity of some of these compounds .|We investigated an epidemic of liver disease in nine industrial workers who had had repeated accidental exposure to a mixture of 1 , 1 - dichloro - 2 , 2 , 2 - trifluoroethane ( HCFC 123 ) and 1 - chloro - 1 , 2 , 2 , 2 - tetrafluoroethane ( HCFC 124 ) .|All nine exposed workers were affected to various degrees .|Both compounds are metabolised in the same way as 1 - bromo - 1 - chloro - 2 , 2 , 2 - trifluoroethane ( halothane ) to form reactive trifluoroacetyl halide intermediates , which have been implicated in the hepatotoxicity of halothane .|We aimed to test whether HCFCs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver disease .|METHODS : For one severely affected worker liver biopsy and immunohistochemical stainings for the presence of trifluoroacetyl protein adducts were done .|The serum of six affected workers and five controls was tested for autoantibodies that react with human liver cytochrome - P450 2E1 ( P450 2E1 ) and P58 protein disulphide isomerase isoform ( P58 ) .|FINDINGS : The liver biopsy sample showed hepatocellular necrosis which was prominent in perivenular zone three and extended focally from portal tracts to portal tracts and centrilobular areas ( bridging necrosis ) .|Trifluoroacetyl - adducted proteins were detected in surviving hepatocytes .|Autoantibodies against P450 2E1 or P58 , previously associated with halothane hepatitis , were detected in the serum of five affected workers .|INTERPRETATION : Repeated exposure of human beings to HCFCs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver injury in a large proportion of the exposed population .|Although the exact mechanism of hepatotoxicity of these agents is not known , the results suggest that trifluoroacetyl - altered liver proteins are involved .|In view of the potentially widespread use of these compounds , there is an urgent need to develop safer alternatives .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	9-10	2-4	D010126	ozone|ozone	Chemical	9:30	10:31	0:1	D008107	liver disease|liver disease|liver disease	Disease	2:56:175	4:58:177	0:3:6	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	14-15	2-4	D017402	chlorofluorocarbons|chlorofluorocarbons|CFCs	Chemical	14:33:35	15:34:36	0:1:1	D008107	liver disease|liver disease|liver disease	Disease	2:56:175	4:58:177	0:3:6	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	175-177	167-171	C067411	1 , 1 -

10704919	Hemolysis of human erythrocytes induced by tamoxifen is related to disruption of membrane structure .|Tamoxifen ( TAM ) , the antiestrogenic drug most widely prescribed in the chemotherapy of breast cancer , induces changes in normal discoid shape of erythrocytes and hemolytic anemia .|This work evaluates the effects of TAM on isolated human erythrocytes , attempting to identify the underlying mechanisms on TAM - induced hemolytic anemia and the involvement of biomembranes in its cytostatic action mechanisms .|TAM induces hemolysis of erythrocytes as a function of concentration .|The extension of hemolysis is variable with erythrocyte samples , but 12 . 5 microM TAM induces total hemolysis of all tested suspensions .|Despite inducing extensive erythrocyte lysis , TAM does not shift the osmotic fragility curves of erythrocytes .|The hemolytic effect of TAM is prevented by low concentrations of alpha - tocopherol ( alpha - T ) and alpha - tocopherol acetate ( alpha - TAc ) ( inactivated functional hydroxyl ) indicating that TAM - induced hemolysis is not related to oxidative membrane damage .|This was further evidenced by absence of oxygen consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with TAM - induced hemolysis .|Furthermore , it was observed that TAM inhibits the peroxidation of human erythrocytes induced by AAPH , thus ruling out TAM - induced cell oxidative stress .|Hemolysis caused by TAM was not preceded by the leakage of K ( + ) from the cells , also excluding a colloid - osmotic type mechanism of hemolysis , according to the effects on osmotic fragility curves .|However , TAM induces release of peripheral proteins of membrane - cytoskeleton and cytosol proteins essentially bound to band 3 .|Either alpha - T or alpha - TAc increases membrane packing and prevents TAM partition into model membranes .|These effects suggest that the protection from hemolysis by tocopherols is related to a decreased TAM incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently avoided .|Therefore , TAM - induced hemolysis results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane , leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused by its high partition in the membrane .|These defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by TAM , resulting in hemolytic anemia .|Additionally , since membrane leakage is a final stage of cytotoxicity , the disruption of the structural characteristics of biomembranes by TAM may contribute to the multiple mechanisms of its anticancer action .	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	82-83	80-81	D013629	tamoxifen|Tamoxifen|TAM|TAM|TAM|TAM|TAM|TAM|TAM|TAM|TAM|TAM|TAM|TAM|TAM|TAM|TAM|TAM|TAM|TAM	Chemical	6:15:17:51:64:80:106:121:136:168:197:208:222:232:270:302:323:342:391:419	7:16:18:52:65:81:107:122:137:169:198:209:223:233:271:303:324:343:392:420	0:1:1:2:2:3:4:5:6:6:7:8:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15	D006461	Hemolysis|hemolysis|hemolysis|hemolysis|hemolytic|hemolysis|hemolysis|Hemolysis|hemolysis|hemolysis|hemolysis	Disease	0:82:94:109:133:171:200:229:257:315:345	1:83:95:110:134:172:201:230:258:316:346	0:3:4:4:6:6:7:9:9:12:13	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	143-146	133-134	D024502	alpha -

10721819	Effects of long - term pretreatment with isoproterenol on bromocriptine - induced tachycardia in conscious rats .|It has been shown that bromocriptine - induced tachycardia , which persisted after adrenalectomy , is ( i ) mediated by central dopamine D2 receptor activation and ( ii ) reduced by 5 - day isoproterenol pretreatment , supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart .|This study was conducted to examine whether prolonged pretreatment with isoproterenol could abolish bromocriptine - induced tachycardia in conscious rats .|Isoproterenol pretreatment for 15 days caused cardiac hypertrophy without affecting baseline blood pressure and heart rate .|In control rats , intravenous bromocriptine ( 150 microg / kg ) induced significant hypotension and tachycardia .|Bromocriptine - induced hypotension was unaffected by isoproterenol pretreatment , while tachycardia was reversed to significant bradycardia , an effect that was partly reduced by i . v .|domperidone ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) .|Neither cardiac vagal nor sympathetic tone was altered by isoproterenol pretreatment .|In isolated perfused heart preparations from isoproterenol - pretreated rats , the isoproterenol - induced maximal increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly reduced , compared with saline - pretreated rats ( the EC50 of the isoproterenol - induced increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was enhanced approximately 22 - fold ) .|These results show that 15 - day isoproterenol pretreatment not only abolished but reversed bromocriptine -

renal insufficiency who developed two episodes of transient anuria after losartan administration .|He was hospitalized for a myocardial infarction with pulmonary edema , treated with high - dose diuretics .|Due to severe systolic dysfunction losartan was prescribed .|Surprisingly , the first dose of 50 mg of losartan resulted in a sudden anuria , which lasted eight hours despite high - dose furosemide and amine infusion .|One week later , by mistake , losartan was prescribed again and after the second dose of 50 mg , the patient developed a second episode of transient anuria lasting 10 hours .|During these two episodes , his blood pressure diminished but no severe hypotension was noted .|Ultimately , an arteriography showed a 70 - 80 % renal artery stenosis .|In this patient , renal artery stenosis combined with heart failure and diuretic therapy certainly resulted in a strong activation of the renin - angiotensin system ( RAS ) .|Under such conditions , angiotensin II receptor blockade by losartan probably induced a critical fall in glomerular filtration pressure .|This case report highlights the fact that the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan can cause serious unexpected complications in patients with renovascular disease and should be used with extreme caution in this setting

11334364	In vivo protection of dna damage associated apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths during acetaminophen - induced nephrotoxicity , amiodarone - induced lung toxicity and doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity by a novel IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract .|Grape seed extract , primarily a mixture of proanthocyanidins , has been shown to modulate a wide - range of biological , pharmacological and toxicological effects which are mainly cytoprotective .|This study assessed the ability of IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract ( GSPE ) to prevent acetaminophen ( AAP ) - induced nephrotoxicity , amiodarone ( AMI ) - induced lung toxicity , and doxorubicin ( DOX ) - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .|Experimental design consisted of four groups : control ( vehicle alone ) , GSPE alone , drug alone and GSPE + drug .|For the cytoprotection study , animals were orally gavaged 100 mg / Kg GSPE for 7 - 10 days followed by i . p .|injections of organ specific three drugs ( AAP : 500 mg / Kg for 24 h ; AMI : 50 mg / Kg / day for four days ; DOX : 20 mg / Kg for 48 h ) .|Parameters of study included analysis of serum chemistry ( ALT , BUN and CPK ) , and orderly fragmentation of genomic DNA ( both endonuclease - dependent and independent ) in addition to microscopic evaluation of damage and / or protection in corresponding PAS stained tissues .|Results indicate that GSPE preexposure prior to AAP , AMI and DOX , provided near complete protection in terms of serum chemistry changes ( ALT , BUN and CPK ) , and significantly reduced DNA fragmentation .|Histopathological examination of kidney , heart and lung sections revealed moderate to massive tissue damage with a variety of morphological aberrations by all the three drugs in the absence of GSPE preexposure than in its presence .|GSPE + drug exposed tissues exhibited minor residual damage or near total recovery .|Additionally , histopathological alterations mirrored both serum chemistry changes and the pattern of DNA fragmentation .|Interestingly , all the drugs , such as , AAP , AMI and DOX induced apoptotic death in addition to necrosis in the respective organs which was very effectively blocked by GSPE .|Since AAP , AMI and DOX undergo biotransformation and are known to produce damaging radicals in vivo , the protection by GSPE may be linked to both inhibition of metabolism and / or detoxification of cytotoxic radicals .|In addition , its ' presumed contribution to DNA repair may be another important attribute , which played a role in the chemoprevention process .|Additionally , this may have been the first report on AMI - induced apoptotic death in the lung tissue .|Taken together , these events undoubtedly establish GSPE 's abundant bioavailability , and the power to defend multiple target organs from toxic assaults induced by structurally diverse and functionally different entities in vivo .	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	13-14	9-10	D000082	acetaminophen|acetaminophen|AAP|AAP|AAP|AAP|AAP	Chemical	13:84:86:167:254:360:385	14:85:87:168:255:361:386	0:2:2:5:7:11:12	D009336	necrotic|necrosis	Disease	9:371	10:372	0:11	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	18-19	9-10	D000638	amiodarone|amiodarone|AMI|AMI|AMI|AMI|AMI|AMI	Chemical	18:92:94:177:256:362:387:457	19:93:95:178:257:363:388:458	0:2:2:5:7:11:12:14	D009336	necrotic|necrosis	Disease	9:371	10:372	0:11	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	371-372	364-365	D004317	doxorubicin|doxorubicin|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX	Chemical	24:102:104:189:258:364:389	25:103:105:190:259:365:390	0:2:2:5:7:11:12	D009336	necrotic|necrosis	Disease	9:371	10:372	0:11	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	382-383	371-372	C511402	IH636

17600377	A novel compound , maltolyl p - coumarate , attenuates cognitive deficits and shows neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo dementia models .|To develop a novel and effective drug that could enhance cognitive function and neuroprotection , we newly synthesized maltolyl p - coumarate by the esterification of maltol and p - coumaric acid .|In the present study , we investigated whether maltolyl p - coumarate could improve cognitive decline in scopolamine - injected rats and in amyloid beta peptide ( 1 - 42 ) - infused rats .|Maltolyl p - coumarate was found to attenuate cognitive deficits in both rat models using passive avoidance test and to reduce apoptotic cell death observed in the hippocampus of the amyloid beta peptide ( 1 - 42 ) - infused rats .|We also examined the neuroprotective effects of maltolyl p - coumarate in vitro using SH - SY5Y cells .|Cells were pretreated with maltolyl p - coumarate , before exposed to amyloid beta peptide ( 1 - 42 ) , glutamate or H2O2 .|We found that maltolyl p - coumarate significantly decreased apoptotic cell death and reduced reactive oxygen species , cytochrome c release , and caspase 3 activation .|Taking these in vitro and in vivo results together , our study suggests that maltolyl p - coumarate is a potentially effective candidate against Alzheimer 's disease that is characterized by wide spread neuronal death and progressive decline of cognitive function .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	4-8	10-12	C524754	maltolyl p -

17639754	Interaction between warfarin and levofloxacin : case series .|Warfarin is the most widely used oral anticoagulant and is indicated for many clinical conditions .|Levofloxacin , a fluoroquinolone , is one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in clinical practice and is effective against Gram - positive , Gram - negative , and atypical bacteria .|While small prospective studies have not revealed any significant drug - drug interaction between warfarin and levofloxacin , several case reports have indicated that levofloxacin may significantly potentiate the anticoagulation effect of warfarin .|We report 3 cases of serious bleeding complications that appear to be the result of the interaction between warfarin and levofloxacin .|Physicians should be aware of this potential interaction and use caution when prescribing levofloxacin to patients taking warfarin .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	89-90	97-98	D014859	warfarin|Warfarin|warfarin|warfarin|warfarin|warfarin	Chemical	2:9:71:89:109:130	3:10:72:90:110:131	0:1:3:3:4:5	D006470	bleeding	Disease	97	98	4	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	97-98	111-112	D064704	levofloxacin|Levofloxacin|levofloxacin|levofloxacin|levofloxacin|levofloxacin	Chemical	4:25:73:81:111:126	5:26:74:82:112:127	0:2:3:3:4:5	D006470	bleeding	Disease	97	98	4	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	28-29	97-98	D024841	fluoroquinolone	Chemical	28	29	2	D006470	bleeding	Disease	97	98	4
17854040	Mutations associated with lamivudine - resistance in therapy - na ve hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infected patients with and without HIV co - infection : implications for antiretroviral therapy in HBV and HIV co - infected South African patients .|This was an exploratory study to investigate lamivudine - resistant hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) strains in selected lamivudine - na ve HBV carriers with and without human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) co - infection in South African patients .|Thirty - five lamivudine - na ve HBV infected patients with or without HIV co - infection were studied : 15 chronic HBV mono - infected patients and 20 HBV - HIV co - infected patients .|The latter group was further sub - divided into 13 occult HBV ( HBsAg - negative ) and 7 overt HBV ( HBsAg - positive ) patients .|HBsAg , anti - HBs , anti - HBc , and anti - HIV 1 / 2 were determined as part of routine diagnosis using Axsym assays ( Abbott Laboratories , North Chicago , IL ) .|Serum samples were PCR amplified with HBV reverse transcriptase ( RT ) primers , followed by direct sequencing across the tyrosine - methionine - aspartate - aspartate ( YMDD ) motif of the major catalytic region in the C domain of the HBV RT enzyme .|HBV viral load was performed with Amplicor HBV Monitor test v2 . 0 ( Roche Diagnostics , Penzberg , Germany ) .|HBV lamivudine - resistant strains were detected in 3 of 15 mono - infected chronic hepatitis B patients and 10 of 20 HBV - HIV co - infected patients .|To the best of our knowledge , this constitutes the first report of HBV lamivudine - resistant strains in therapy - na ve HBV - HIV co - infected patients .|The HBV viral loads for mono - infected and co - infected patients ranged from 3 . 32 x 10 ( 2 ) to 3 . 82 x 10 ( 7 ) and < 200 to 4 . 40 x 10 ( 3 ) copies / ml , respectively .|It remains to be seen whether such pre - existing antiviral mutations could result in widespread emergence of HBV resistant strains when lamivudine - containing highly active antiretroviral ( ARV ) treatment ( HAART ) regimens become widely applied in South Africa , as this is likely to have potential implications in the management of HBV - HIV co - infected patients .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	49-50	52-54	D019259	lamivudine|lamivudine|lamivudine|lamivudine|lamivudine|lamivudine|lamivudine	Chemical	3:49:61:87:255:298:387	4:50:62:88:256:299:388	0:1:1:2:7:8:10	D006509	hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infected|HBV and HIV co -

18768591	Serum - and glucocorticoid - inducible kinase 1 in doxorubicin - induced nephrotic syndrome .|Doxorubicin - induced nephropathy leads to epithelial sodium channel ( ENaC ) - dependent volume retention and renal fibrosis .|The aldosterone - sensitive serum - and glucocorticoid - inducible kinase SGK1 has been shown to participate in the stimulation of ENaC and to mediate renal fibrosis following mineralocorticoid and salt excess .|The present study was performed to elucidate the role of SGK1 in the volume retention and fibrosis during nephrotic syndrome .|To this end , doxorubicin ( 15 mug / g body wt ) was injected intravenously into gene - targeted mice lacking SGK1 ( sgk1 ( - / - ) ) and their wild - type littermates ( sgk1 ( + / + ) ) .|Doxorubicin treatment resulted in heavy proteinuria ( > 100 mg protein / mg crea ) in 15 / 44 of sgk1 ( + / + ) and 15 / 44 of sgk1 ( - / - ) mice leading to severe nephrotic syndrome with ascites , lipidemia , and hypoalbuminemia in both genotypes .|Plasma aldosterone levels increased in nephrotic mice of both genotypes and was followed by increased SGK1 protein expression in sgk1 ( + / + ) mice .|Urinary sodium excretion reached signficantly lower values in sgk1 ( + / + ) mice ( 15 + / - 5 mumol / mg crea ) than in sgk1 ( - / - ) mice ( 35 + / - 5 mumol / mg crea ) and was associated with a significantly higher body weight gain in sgk1 ( + / + ) compared with sgk1 ( - / - ) mice ( + 6 . 6 + / - 0 . 7 vs . + 4 . 1 + / - 0 . 8 g ) .|During the course of nephrotic syndrome , serum urea concentrations increased significantly faster in sgk1 ( - / - ) mice than in sgk1 ( + / + ) mice leading to uremia and a reduced median survival in sgk1 ( - / - ) mice ( 29 vs . 40 days in sgk1 ( + / + ) mice ) .|In conclusion , gene - targeted mice lacking SGK1 showed blunted volume retention , yet were not protected against renal fibrosis during experimental nephrotic syndrome

19356053	Clinically significant proteinuria following the administration of sirolimus to renal transplant recipients .|BACKGROUND : Sirolimus is the latest immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection , and may have less nephrotoxicity than calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) - based regimens .|To date there has been little documentation of clinically significant proteinuria linked with the use of sirolimus .|We have encountered several patients who developed substantial proteinuria associated with sirolimus use .|In each patient , the close temporal association between the commencement of sirolimus therapy and proteinuria implicated sirolimus as the most likely etiology of the proteinuria .|METHODS : We analyzed the clinical and laboratory information available for all 119 patients transplanted at the Washington Hospital Center between 1999 - 2003 for whom sirolimus was a component of their immunosuppressant regimen .|In these patients , the magnitude of proteinuria was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein : creatinine ratios , an estimate of grams of proteinuria / day .|Laboratory results were compared between prior , during and following sirolimus use .|RESULTS : Twenty - eight patients ( 24 % ) developed increased proteinuria from baseline during their post - transplantation course .|In 21 patients an alternative cause of proteinuria was either obvious or insufficient data was available to be conclusive .|In 7 of the 28 patients there was a striking temporal association between the initiation of sirolimus and the development of nephrotic - range proteinuria .|Proteinuria correlated most strongly with sirolimus therapy when compared to other demographic and clinical variables .|In most patients , discontinuation of sirolimus resulted in a decrease , but not resolution , of proteinuria .|CONCLUSIONS : Sirolimus induces or aggravates pre - existing proteinuria in an unpredictable subset of renal allograft recipients .|Proteinuria may improve , but does not resolve , when sirolimus is withdrawn .	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	90-91	88-89	D020123	sirolimus|Sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|Sirolimus|sirolimus	Chemical	7:15:57:70:85:90:126:179:240:255:272:287:314	8:16:58:71:86:91:127:180:241:256:273:288:315	0:1:2:3:4:4:5:7:10:11:12:13:14	D011507	proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria|Proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria|Proteinuria	Disease	2:51:67:88:98:142:165:194:211:248:250:283:294:304	3:52:68:89:99:143:166:195:212:249:251:284:295:305	0:2:3:4:4:6:6:8:9:10:11:12:13:14	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	165-166	157-158	D003404	creatinine	Chemical	157	158	6	D011507	proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria|Proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria|Proteinuria	Disease	2:51:67:88:98:142:165:194:211:248:250:283:294:304	3:52:68:89:99:143:166:195:212:249:251:284:295:305	0:2:3:4:4:6:6:8:9:10:11:12:13:14	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	15-16	30-31	D020123	sirolimus|Sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|Sirolimus|sirolimus	Chemical	7:15:57:70:85:90:126:179:240:255:272:287:314	8:16:58:71:86:91:127:180:241:256:273:288:315	0:1:2:3:4:4:5:7:10:11:12:13:14	D007674	nephrotoxicity	Disease	30	31	1	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	240-241	245-246	D020123	sirolimus|Sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|sirolimus|Sirolimus|sirolimus	Chemical	7:15:57:70:85:90:126:179:240:255:272:287:314	8:16:58:71:86:91:127:180:241:256:273:288:315	0:1:2:3:4:4:5:7:10:11:12:13:14	D009404	nephrotic	Disease	245	246	10	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	157-158	30-31	D003404	creatinine	Chemical	157	158	6	D007674	nephrotoxicity	Disease	30	31	1	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	157-158	245-246	D003404	creatinine	Chemical	157	158	6	D009404	nephrotic	Disease	245	246	10

18752389	Simvastatin - ezetimibe - induced hepatic failure necessitating liver transplantation .|Abstract Serum aminotransferase elevations are a commonly known adverse effect of 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor ( statin ) therapy .|However , hepatotoxic events have not been widely published with ezetimibe or the combination agent simvastatin - ezetimibe .|We describe a 70 - year - old Hispanic woman who developed fulminant hepatic failure necessitating liver transplantation 10 weeks after conversion from simvastatin 40 mg / day to simvastatin 10 mg - ezetimibe 40 mg / day .|The patient 's lipid panel had been maintained with simvastatin for 18 months before the conversion without evidence of hepatotoxicity .|A routine laboratory work - up 10 weeks after conversion revealed elevated serum aminotransferase levels .|Simvastatinezetimibe and escitalopram ( which she was taking for depression ) were discontinued , and other potential causes of hepatotoxicity were excluded .|A repeat work - up revealed further elevations in aminotransferase levels , and liver biopsy revealed evidence of moderate - to - severe drug toxicity .|She underwent liver transplantation with an uneventful postoperative course .|Her aminotransferase levels returned to normal by postoperative day 23 , and her 2 - year follow - up showed no adverse events .|Ezetimibe undergoes extensive glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate glucoronosyltransferases ( UGT ) in the intestine and liver and may have inhibited the glucuronidation of simvastatin hydroxy acid , resulting in increased simvastatin exposure and subsequent hepatotoxicity .|To our knowledge , this is the first case report of simvastatin - ezetimibe - induced liver failure that resulted in liver transplantation .|We postulate that the mechanism of the simvastatinezetimibe - induced hepatotoxicity is the increased simvastatin exposure by ezetimibe inhibition of UGT enzymes .|Clinicians should be aware of potential hepatotoxicity with simvastatin - ezetimibe especially in elderly patients and should carefully monitor serum aminotransferase levels when starting therapy and titrating the dosage .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	0-3	5-7	C492458	Simvastatin -

" Although three different dental treatment modalities ( either conventional or implant - supported ) have been offered to the patient since August 2007 , the patient has yet to initiate any treatment .|CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE : This clinical case showing oral manifestations of meth mouth was presented to help dental practitioners recognize and manage patients who may be abusing methamphetamines .|Dental practitioners also may be skeptical about the reliability of appointment keeping by these patients , as they frequently miss their appointments without reasonable justification .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	66-68	80-81	D008694	Methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamines	Chemical	45:80:109:174:277	46:81:110:175:278	2:3:4:7:9	D001145	cardiac dysrhythmias	Disease	66	68	2	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	69-70	80-81	D008694	Methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamines	Chemical	45:80:109:174:277	46:81:110:175:278	2:3:4:7:9	D006973	hypertension	Disease	69	70	2	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	71-72	80-81	D008694	Methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamines	Chemical	45:80:109:174:277	46:81:110:175:278	2:3:4:7:9	D006212	hallucinations	Disease	71	72	2	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	74-76	80-81	D008694	Methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamines	Chemical	45:80:109:174:277	46:81:110:175:278	2:3:4:7:9	D001523	violent behavior	Disease	74	76	2	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	80-81	88-89	D008694	Methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamines	Chemical	45:80:109:174:277	46:81:110:175:278	2:3:4:7:9	D014987	xerostomia	Disease	88	89	3	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	174-175	184-186	D008694	Methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamines	Chemical	45:80:109:174:277	46:81:110:175:278	2:3:4:7:9	D003731	caries|carious lesions|carious episodes	Disease	91:156:184	92:158:186	3:6:7	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	101-103	109-110	D008694	Methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamines	Chemical	45:80:109:174:277	46:81:110:175:278	2:3:4:7:9	D057085	tooth wear	Disease	101	103	3	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	109-110	128-129	D008694	Methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamines	Chemical	45:80:109:174:277	46:81:110:175:278	2:3:4:7:9	D010146	pain	Disease	128	129	5	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	109-110	130-132	D008694	Methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamine|methamphetamines	Chemical	45:80:109:174:277	46:81:110:175:278	2:3:4:7:9	D012120	bad breath	Disease	130	132	5

9660111	Repeated trimipramine induces dopamine D2 / D3 and alpha1 - adrenergic up - regulation .|Trimipramine ( TRI ) , which shows a clinical antidepressant activity , is chemically related to imipramine but does not inhibit the reuptake of noradrenaline and 5 - hydroxytryptamine , nor does it induce beta - adrenergic down - regulation .|The mechanism of its antidepressant activity is still unknown .|The aim of the present study was to find out whether TRI given repeatedly was able to induce adaptive changes in the dopaminergic and alpha1 - adrenergic systems , demonstrated by us previously for various antidepressants .|TRI was given to male Wistar rats and male Albino Swiss mice perorally twice daily for 14 days .|In the acute experiment TRI ( given i . p . ) does not antagonize the reserpine hypothermia in mice and does not potentiate the 5 - hydroxytryptophan head twitches in rats .|TRI given repeatedly to rats increases the locomotor hyperactivity induced by d - amphetamine , quinpirole and ( + ) - 7 - hydroxy - dipropyloaminotetralin ( dopamine D2 and D3 effects ) .|The stereotypies induced by d - amphetamine or apomorphine are not potentiated by TRI .|It increases the behaviour stimulation evoked by phenylephrine ( given intraventricularly ) in rats , evaluated in the open field test as well as the aggressiveness evoked by clonidine in mice , both these effects being mediated by an alpha1 - adrenergic receptor .|It may be concluded that , like other tricyclic antidepressants studied previously , TRI given repeatedly increases the responsiveness of brain dopamine D2 and D3 ( locomotor activity but not stereotypy ) as well as alpha1 - adrenergic receptors to their agonists .|A question arises whether the reuptake inhibition is of any importance to the adaptive changes induced by repeated antidepressants , suggested to be responsible for the antidepressant activity .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	126-127	139-140	D014299	trimipramine|Trimipramine|TRI|TRI|TRI|TRI|TRI|TRI|TRI	Chemical	1:15:17:77:103:126:155:202:261	2:16:18:78:104:127:156:203:262	0:1:1:3:4:5:6:7:9	D007035	hypothermia	Disease	139	140	5	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	155-156	163-164	D014299	trimipramine|Trimipramine|TRI|TRI|TRI|TRI|TRI|TRI|TRI	Chemical	1:15:17:77:103:126:155:202:261	2:16:18:78:104:127:156:203:262	0:1:1:3:4:5:6:7:9	D006948	hyperactivity	Disease	163	164	6	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	202-203	229-230	D014299	trimipramine|Trimipramine|TRI|TRI|TRI|TRI|TRI|TRI|TRI	Chemical	1:15:17:77:103:126:155:202:261	2:16:18:78:104:127:156:203:262	0:1:1:3:4:5:6:7:9	D010554	aggressiveness	Disease	229	230	8	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	139-140	182-183	D004298	dopamine|dopamine|dopamine	Chemical	3:182:269	4:183:270	0:6:9	D007035	hypothermia	Disease	139	140	5	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	163-164	182-183	D004298	dopamine|dopamine|dopamine	Chemical	3:182:269	4:183:270	0:6:9	D006948	hyperactivity	Disease	163	164	6	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	229-230	269-270	D004298	dopamine|dopamine|dopamine	Chemical	3:182:269	4:183:270	0:6:9	D010554	aggressiveness	Disease	229	230	8	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	101-102	139-140	D000928	antidepressant|antidepressant|antidepressants|antidepressants|antidepressants|antidepressant	Chemical	24:60:101:257:309:317	25:61:102:258:310:318	1:2:3:9:10:10	D007035	hypothermia	Disease	139	140	5	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	101-102	163-164	D000928	antidepressant|antidepressant|antidepressants|antidepressants|antidepressants|antidepressant	Chemical	24:60:101:257:309:317	25:61:102:258:310:318	1:2:3:9:10:10	D006948	hyperactivity	Disease	163	164	6	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	229-230	257-258	D000928	antidepressant|antidepressant|antidepressants|antidepressants|antidepressants|antidepressant	Chemical	24:60:101:257:309:317	25:61:102:258:310:318	1:2:3:9:10:10	D010554	aggressiveness	Disease	229	230	8	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	31-32	139-140	D007099	imipramine	Chemical	31	32	1	D007035	hypothermia	Disease	139	140	5	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	31-32	163-164	D007099	imipramine	Chemical	31	32	1	D006948	hyperactivity	Disease	163	164	6	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	31-32	229-230	D007099	imipramine	Chemical	31	32	1	D010554	aggressiveness	Disease	229	230	8	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	39-40	139-140	D009638	noradrenaline	Chemical	39	40	1	D007035	hypothermia	Disease	139	140	5	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	39-40	163-164	D009638	noradrenaline	Chemical	39	40	1	D006948	hyperactivity	Disease	163	164	6	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	39-40	229-230	D009638	noradrenaline	Chemical	39	40	1	D010554	aggressiveness	Disease	229	230	8	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	41-44	139-140	D012701	5 -

17615423	Severe rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure secondary to concomitant use of simvastatin , amiodarone , and atazanavir .|OBJECTIVE : To report a case of a severe interaction between simvastatin , amiodarone , and atazanavir resulting in rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure .|BACKGROUND : A 72 - year - old white man with underlying human immunodeficiency virus , atrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease , and hyperlipidemia presented with generalized pain , fatigue , and dark orange urine for 3 days .|The patient was taking 80 mg simvastatin at bedtime ( initiated 27 days earlier ) ; amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg daily for 7 days , then 200 mg daily ( initiated 19 days earlier ) ; and 400 mg atazanavir daily ( initiated at least 2 years previously ) .|Laboratory evaluation revealed 66 , 680 U / L creatine kinase , 93 mg / dL blood urea nitrogen , 4 . 6 mg / dL creatinine , 1579 U / L aspartate aminotransferase , and 738 U / L alanine aminotransferase .|Simvastatin , amiodarone , and the patient 's human immunodeficiency virus medications were all temporarily discontinued and the patient was given forced alkaline diuresis and started on dialysis .|Nine days later the patient 's creatine kinase had dropped to 1695 U / L and creatinine was 3 . 3 mg / dL .|The patient was discharged and continued outpatient dialysis for 1 month until his renal function recovered .|DISCUSSION : The risk of rhabdomyolysis is increased in the presence of concomitant drugs that inhibit simvastatin metabolism .|Simvastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4 .|Amiodarone and atazanavir are recognized CYP3A4 inhibitors .|CONCLUSIONS : Pharmacokinetic differences in statins are an important consideration for assessing the risk of potential drug interactions .|In patients requiring the concurrent use of statins and CYP3A4 inhibitors , pravastatin , fluvastatin , and rosuvastatin carry the lowest risk of drug interactions ; atorvastatin carries moderate risk , whereas simvastatin and lovastatin have the highest risk and should be avoided in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors

9812111	A randomized , placebo - controlled dose - comparison trial of haloperidol for psychosis and disruptive behaviors in Alzheimer 's disease .|OBJECTIVE : The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of two doses of haloperidol and placebo in the treatment of psychosis and disruptive behaviors in patients with Alzheimer 's disease .|METHOD : In a 6 - week random - assignment , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial ( phase A ) , haloperidol , 2 - 3 mg / day ( standard dose ) , and haloperidol , 0 . 50 - 0 . 75 mg / day ( low dose ) , were compared in 71 outpatients with Alzheimer 's disease .|For the subsequent 6 - week double - blind crossover phase ( phase B ) , patients taking standard - or low - dose haloperidol were switched to placebo , and patients taking placebo were randomly assigned to standard - or low - dose haloperidol .|RESULTS : For the 60 patients who completed phase A , standard - dose haloperidol was efficacious and superior to both low - dose haloperidol and placebo for scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis factor and on psychomotor agitation .|Response rates according to three sets of criteria were greater with the standard dose ( 55 % - 60 % ) than the low dose ( 25 % - 35 % ) and placebo ( 25 % - 30 % ) .|The advantage of standard dose over low dose was replicated in phase B .|In phase A , extrapyramidal signs tended to be greater with the standard dose than in the other two conditions , primarily because of a subgroup ( 20 % ) who developed moderate to severe signs .|Low - dose haloperidol did not differ from placebo on any measure of efficacy or side effects .|CONCLUSIONS : The results indicated a favorable therapeutic profile for haloperidol in doses of 2 - 3 mg / day , although a subgroup developed moderate to severe extrapyramidal signs .|A starting dose of 1 mg / day with gradual , upward dose titration is recommended .|The narrow therapeutic window observed with haloperidol may also apply to other neuroleptics used in Alzheimer 's disease patients with psychosis and disruptive behaviors .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	11-12	13-14	D006220	haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol	Chemical	11:41:83:97:148:168:184:194:308:333:377	12:42:84:98:149:169:185:195:309:334:378	0:1:2:2:3:3:4:4:8:9:11	D011618	psychosis|psychosis|psychosis|psychosis	Disease	13:48:205:391	14:49:206:392	0:1:4:11	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	11-12	15-17	D006220	haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol	Chemical	11:41:83:97:148:168:184:194:308:333:377	12:42:84:98:149:169:185:195:309:334:378	0:1:2:2:3:3:4:4:8:9:11	D019958	disruptive behaviors|disruptive behaviors|disruptive behaviors	Disease	15:50:393	17:52:395	0:1:11	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	11-12	18-21	D006220	haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol	Chemical	11:41:83:97:148:168:184:194:308:333:377	12:42:84:98:149:169:185:195:309:334:378	0:1:2:2:3:3:4:4:8:9:11	D000544	Alzheimer 's disease|Alzheimer 's disease|Alzheimer 's disease|Alzheimer 's disease	Disease	18:55:120:386	21:58:123:389	0:1:2:11	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	194-195	209-211	D006220	haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol	Chemical	11:41:83:97:148:168:184:194:308:333:377	12:42:84:98:149:169:185:195:309:334:378	0:1:2:2:3:3:4:4:8:9:11	D011595	psychomotor agitation	Disease	209	211	4	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	333-334	351-353	D006220	haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol	Chemical	11:41:83:97:148:168:184:194:308:333:377	12:42:84:98:149:169:185:195:309:334:378	0:1:2:2:3:3:4:4:8:9:11	D001480	extrapyramidal signs|extrapyramidal signs	Disease	272:351	274:353	7:9
15572383	Individual differences in renal ACE activity in healthy rats predict susceptibility to adriamycin - induced renal damage .|BACKGROUND : In man , differences in angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) levels , related to ACE ( I / D ) genotype , are associated with renal prognosis .|This raises the hypothesis that individual differences in renal ACE activity are involved in renal susceptibility to inflicted damage .|Therefore , we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of renal damage induced by a single injection of adriamycin in rats .|METHODS : Renal ACE activity ( Hip - His - Leu cleavage by cortical homogenates ) was determined by renal biopsy in 27 adult male Wistar rats .|After 1 week of recovery , proteinuria was induced by adriamycin [ 1 . 5 mg / kg intravenously ( i . v . ) n = 18 ; controls , saline i . v .|n = 9 ] .|Proteinuria was measured every 2 weeks .|After 12 weeks , rats were sacrificed and their kidneys harvested .|RESULTS : As anticipated , adriamycin elicited nephrotic range proteinuria , renal interstitial damage and mild focal glomerulosclerosis .|Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in proteinuria after adriamycin ( r = 0 . 62 , P < 0 . 01 ) , renal interstitial alpha - smooth muscle actin ( r = 0 . 49 , P < 0 . 05 ) , interstitial macrophage influx ( r = 0 . 56 , P < 0 . 05 ) , interstitial collagen III ( r = 0 . 53 , P < 0 . 05 ) , glomerular alpha - smooth muscle actin ( r = 0 . 74 , P < 0 . 01 ) and glomerular desmin ( r = 0 . 48 , P < 0 . 05 ) .|Baseline renal ACE did not correlate with focal glomerulosclerosis ( r = 0 . 22 , NS ) .|In controls , no predictive values for renal parameters were observed .|CONCLUSION : Individual differences in renal ACE activity predict the severity of adriamycin - induced renal damage in this outbred rat strain .|This supports the assumption that differences in renal ACE activity predispose to a less favourable course of renal damage .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	12-13	15-17	D004317	adriamycin|adriamycin|adriamycin|adriamycin|adriamycin|adriamycin	Chemical	12:93:135:190:216:365	13:94:136:191:217:366	0:3:5:9:10:13	D007674	renal damage|renal damage|renal interstitial damage|renal damage|renal damage	Disease	15:85:196:368:393	17:87:199:370:395	0:3:9:13:14	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	214-215	216-217	D004317	adriamycin|adriamycin|adriamycin|adriamycin|adriamycin|adriamycin	Chemical	12:93:135:190:216:365	13:94:136:191:217:366	0:3:5:9:10:13	D011507	proteinuria|Proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria	Disease	131:166:194:214	132:167:195:215	5:7:9:10	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	190-191	192-193	D004317	adriamycin|adriamycin|adriamycin|adriamycin|adriamycin|adriamycin	Chemical	12:93:135:190:216:365	13:94:136:191:217:366	0:3:5:9:10:13	D009404	nephrotic	Disease	192	193	9	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	190-191	201-203	D004317	adriamycin|adriamycin|adriamycin|adriamycin|adriamycin|adriamycin	Chemical	12:93:135:190:216:365	13:94:136:191:217:366	0:3:5:9:10:13	D005923	focal glomerulosclerosis|focal glomerulosclerosis	Disease	201:329	203:331	9:11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	25-26	15-17	D000809	angiotensin	Chemical	25	26	1	D007674	renal damage|renal damage|renal interstitial damage|renal damage|renal damage	Disease	15:85:196:368:393	17:87:199:370:395	0:3:9:13:14	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	103-108	85-87	C010980	Hip - His - Leu	Chemical	103	108	4	D007674	renal damage|renal damage|renal interstitial damage|renal damage|renal damage	Disease	15:85:196:368:393	17:87:199:370:395	0:3:9:13:14	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	25-26	131-132	D000809	angiotensin	Chemical	25	26	1	D011507	proteinuria|Proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria	Disease	131:166:194:214	132:167:195:215	5:7:9:10	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	25-26	192-193	D000809	angiotensin	Chemical	25	26	1	D009404	nephrotic	Disease	192	193	9	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	25-26	201-203	D000809	angiotensin	Chemical	25	26	1	D005923	focal glomerulosclerosis|focal glomerulosclerosis	Disease	201:329	203:331	9:11	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	103-108	131-132	C010980	Hip - His - Leu	Chemical	103	108	4	D011507	proteinuria|Proteinuria|proteinuria|proteinuria	Disease	131:166:194:214	132:167:195:215	5:7:9:10	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	103-108	192-193	C010980	Hip - His - Leu	Chemical	103	108	4	D009404	nephrotic	Disease	192	193	9	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	103-108	201-203	C010980	Hip - His - Leu	Chemical	103	108	4	D005923	focal glomerulosclerosis|focal glomerulosclerosis	Disease	201:329	203:331	9:11

12589964	Evaluation of cardiac troponin I and T levels as markers of myocardial damage in doxorubicin - induced cardiomyopathy rats , and their relationship with echocardiographic and histological findings .|BACKGROUND : Cardiac troponins I ( cTnI ) and T ( cTnT ) have been shown to be highly sensitive and specific markers of myocardial cell injury .|We investigated the diagnostic value of cTnI and cTnT for the diagnosis of myocardial damage in a rat model of doxorubicin ( DOX ) - induced cardiomyopathy , and we examined the relationship between serial cTnI and cTnT with the development of cardiac disorders monitored by echocardiography and histological examinations in this model .|METHODS : Thirty - five Wistar rats were given 1 . 5 mg / kg DOX , i . v . , weekly for up to 8 weeks for a total cumulative dose of 12 mg / kg BW .|Ten rats received saline as a control group .|cTnI was measured with Access ( R ) ( ng / ml ) and a research immunoassay ( pg / ml ) , and compared with cTnT , CK - MB mass and CK .|By using transthoracic echocardiography , anterior and posterior wall thickness , LV diameters and LV fractional shortening ( FS ) were measured in all rats before DOX or saline , and at weeks 6 and 9 after treatment in all surviving rats .|Histology was performed in DOX - rats at 6 and 9 weeks after the last DOX dose and in all controls .|RESULTS : Eighteen of the DOX rats died prematurely of general toxicity during the 9 - week period .|End - diastolic ( ED ) and end - systolic ( ES ) LV diameters / BW significantly increased , whereas LV FS was decreased after 9 weeks in the DOX group ( p < 0 . 001 ) .|These parameters remained unchanged in controls .|Histological evaluation of hearts from all rats given DOX revealed significant slight degrees of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis .|In 7 of the 18 rats , degeneration and myocyte vacuolisation were found .|Only five of the controls exhibited evidence of very slight perivascular fibrosis .|A significant rise in cTnT was found in DOX rats after cumulative doses of 7 . 5 and 12 mg / kg in comparison with baseline ( p < 0 . 05 ) .|cTnT found in rats after 12 mg / kg were significantly greater than that found after 7 . 5 mg / kg DOX .|Maximal cTnI ( pg / ml ) and cTnT levels were significantly increased in DOX rats compared with controls ( p = 0 . 006 , 0 . 007 ) .|cTnI ( ng / ml ) , CK - MB mass and CK remained unchanged in DOX rats compared with controls .|All markers remained stable in controls .|Analysis of data revealed a significant correlation between maximal cTnT and ED and ES LV diameters / BW ( r = 0 . 81 and 0 . 65 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .|A significant relationship was observed between maximal cTnT and the extent of myocardial morphological changes , and between LV diameters / BW and histological findings .|CONCLUSIONS : Among markers of ischemic injury after DOX in rats , cTnT showed the greatest ability to detect myocardial damage assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes .|Although there was a discrepancy between the amount of cTnI and cTnT after DOX , probably due to heterogeneity in cross - reactivities of mAbs to various cTnI and cTnT forms , it is likely that cTnT in rats after DOX indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that cTnT should be a useful marker for the prediction of experimentally induced cardiotoxicity and possibly for cardioprotective experiments .	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	14-15	11-13	D004317	doxorubicin|doxorubicin|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX	Chemical	14:77:79:126:221:242:253:265:309:334:380:428:444:477:560:594:621	15:78:80:127:222:243:254:266:310:335:381:429:445:478:561:595:622	0:2:2:3:6:7:7:8:9:11:14:15:16:17:21:22:22	D009202	myocardial damage|cardiomyopathy|myocardial cell injury|myocardial damage|cardiomyopathy|myocardial damage	Disease	11:17:53:70:83:571	13:18:56:72:84:573	0:0:1:2:2:21	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	79-80	99-101	D004317	doxorubicin|doxorubicin|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX	Chemical	14:77:79:126:221:242:253:265:309:334:380:428:444:477:560:594:621	15:78:80:127:222:243:254:266:310:335:381:429:445:478:561:595:622	0:2:2:3:6:7:7:8:9:11:14:15:16:17:21:22:22	D006331	cardiac disorders	Disease	99	101	2	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	265-266	271-272	D004317	doxorubicin|doxorubicin|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX	Chemical	14:77:79:126:221:242:253:265:309:334:380:428:444:477:560:594:621	15:78:80:127:222:243:254:266:310:335:381:429:445:478:561:595:622	0:2:2:3:6:7:7:8:9:11:14:15:16:17:21:22:22	D064420	toxicity	Disease	271	272	8	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	334-335	343-344	D004317	doxorubicin|doxorubicin|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX	Chemical	14:77:79:126:221:242:253:265:309:334:380:428:444:477:560:594:621	15:78:80:127:222:243:254:266:310:335:381:429:445:478:561:595:622	0:2:2:3:6:7:7:8:9:11:14:15:16:17:21:22:22	D005355	fibrosis|fibrosis	Disease	343:370	344:371	11:13	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	557-559	560-561	D004317	doxorubicin|doxorubicin|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX	Chemical	14:77:79:126:221:242:253:265:309:334:380:428:444:477:560:594:621	15:78:80:127:222:243:254:266:310:335:381:429:445:478:561:595:622	0:2:2:3:6:7:7:8:9:11:14:15:16:17:21:22:22	D017202	ischemic injury	Disease	557	559	21	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	621-622	646-647	D004317	doxorubicin|doxorubicin|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX|DOX	Chemical	14:77:79:126:221:242:253:265:309:334:380:428:444:477:560:594:621	15:78:80:127:222:243:254:266:310:335:381:429:445:478:561:595:622	0:2:2:3:6:7:7:8:9:11:14:15:16:17:21:22:22	D066126	cardiotoxicity	Disease	646	647	22

11807648	Epileptic seizures following cortical application of fibrin sealants containing tranexamic acid in rats .|BACKGROUND : Fibrin sealants ( FS ) derived from human plasma are frequently used in neurosurgery .|In order to increase clot stability , FS typically contain aprotinin , a natural fibrinolysis inhibitor .|Recently , synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as tranexamic acid ( tAMCA ) have been considered as substitutes for aprotinin .|However , tAMCA has been shown to cause epileptic seizures .|We wanted to study whether tAMCA retains its convulsive action if incorporated into a FS .|METHOD : FS containing aprotinin or different concentrations of tAMCA ( 0 . 5 - 47 . 5 mg / ml ) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rats .|The response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaesthesia .|FINDINGS : FS containing tAMCA caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct convulsive behaviours .|The degree of these seizures increased with increasing concentration of tAMCA .|Thus , FS containing 47 . 5 mg / ml tAMCA evoked generalized seizures in all tested rats ( n = 6 ) while the lowest concentration of tAMCA ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) only evoked brief episodes of jerk - correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rats .|In contrast , FS containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activity .|INTERPRETATION : Tranexamic acid retains its convulsive action within FS .|Thus , use of FS containing tAMCA for surgery within or close to the CNS may pose a substantial risk to the patient .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	76-78	70-71	D014148	tranexamic acid|tranexamic acid|tAMCA|tAMCA|tAMCA|tAMCA|tAMCA|tAMCA|tAMCA|tAMCA|Tranexamic acid|tAMCA	Chemical	9:55:58:70:84:104:156:179:191:209:249:264	11:57:59:71:85:105:157:180:192:210:251:265	0:3:3:4:5:6:8:9:10:10:12:13	D004827	Epileptic seizures|epileptic seizures	Disease	0:76	2:78	0:4	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	191-192	193-195	D014148	tranexamic acid|tranexamic acid|tAMCA|tAMCA|tAMCA|tAMCA|tAMCA|tAMCA|tAMCA|tAMCA|Tranexamic acid|tAMCA	Chemical	9:55:58:70:84:104:156:179:191:209:249:264	11:57:59:71:85:105:157:180:192:210:251:265	0:3:3:4:5:6:8:9:10:10:12:13	D012640	convulsive|convulsive|seizures|generalized seizures|convulsive|convulsive	Disease	87:166:173:193:226:253	88:167:174:195:227:254	5:8:9:10:10:12
14596845	A diet promoting sugar dependency causes behavioral cross - sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine .|Previous research in this laboratory has shown that a diet of intermittent excessive sugar consumption produces a state with neurochemical and behavioral similarities to drug dependency .|The present study examined whether female rats on various regimens of sugar access would show behavioral cross - sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine .|After a 30 - min baseline measure of locomotor activity ( day 0 ) , animals were maintained on a cyclic diet of 12 - h deprivation followed by 12 - h access to 10 % sucrose solution and chow pellets ( 12 h access starting 4 h after onset of the dark period ) for 21 days .|Locomotor activity was measured again for 30 min at the beginning of days 1 and 21 of sugar access .|Beginning on day 22 , all rats were maintained on ad libitum chow .|Nine days later locomotor activity was measured in response to a single low dose of amphetamine ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) .|The animals that had experienced cyclic sucrose and chow were hyperactive in response to amphetamine compared with four control groups ( ad libitum 10 % sucrose and chow followed by amphetamine injection , cyclic chow followed by amphetamine injection , ad libitum chow with amphetamine , or cyclic 10 % sucrose and chow with a saline injection ) .|These results suggest that a diet comprised of alternating deprivation and access to a sugar solution and chow produces bingeing on sugar that leads to a long lasting state of increased sensitivity to amphetamine , possibly due to a lasting alteration in the dopamine system .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	15-16	3-5	D000661	amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine	Chemical	15:68:178:202:218:225:232:280	16:69:179:203:219:226:233:281	0:2:6:7:7:7:7:8	D019966	sugar dependency|drug dependency	Disease	3:41	5:43	0:1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	106-107	41-43	D013395	sucrose|sucrose|sucrose|sucrose	Chemical	106:194:213:238	107:195:214:239	3:7:7:7	D019966	sugar dependency|drug dependency	Disease	3:41	5:43	0:1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	290-291	41-43	D004298	dopamine	Chemical	290	291	8	D019966	sugar dependency|drug dependency	Disease	3:41	5:43	0:1	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	202-203	198-199	D000661	amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine	Chemical	15:68:178:202:218:225:232:280	16:69:179:203:219:226:233:281	0:2:6:7:7:7:7:8	D006948	behavioral cross - sensitization|behavioral cross - sensitization|hyperactive	Disease	6:59:198	10:63:199	0:2:7	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	198-199	194-195	D013395	sucrose|sucrose|sucrose|sucrose	Chemical	106:194:213:238	107:195:214:239	3:7:7:7	D006948	behavioral cross - sensitization|behavioral cross - sensitization|hyperactive	Disease	6:59:198	10:63:199	0:2:7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	290-291	198-199	D004298	dopamine	Chemical	290	291	8	D006948	behavioral cross - sensitization|behavioral cross - sensitization|hyperactive	Disease	6:59:198	10:63:199	0:2:7

19884587	Antibacterial medication use during pregnancy and risk of birth defects : National Birth Defects Prevention Study .|OBJECTIVE : To estimate the association between antibacterial medications and selected birth defects .|DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS : Population - based , multisite , case - control study of women who had pregnancies affected by 1 of more than 30 eligible major birth defects identified via birth defect surveillance programs in 10 states ( n = 13 155 ) and control women randomly selected from the same geographical regions ( n = 4941 ) .|MAIN EXPOSURE : Reported maternal use of antibacterials ( 1 month before pregnancy through the end of the first trimester ) .|MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE : Odds ratios ( ORs ) measuring the association between antibacterial use and selected birth defects adjusted for potential confounders .|RESULTS : The reported use of antibacterials increased during pregnancy , peaking during the third month .|Sulfonamides were associated with anencephaly ( adjusted OR [ AOR ] = 3 . 4 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1 . 3 - 8 . 8 ) , hypoplastic left heart syndrome ( AOR = 3 . 2 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 3 - 7 . 6 ) , coarctation of the aorta ( AOR = 2 . 7 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 3 - 5 . 6 ) , choanal atresia ( AOR = 8 . 0 ; 95 % CI , 2 . 7 - 23 . 5 ) , transverse limb deficiency ( AOR = 2 . 5 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 0 - 5 . 9 ) , and diaphragmatic hernia ( AOR = 2 . 4 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 1 - 5 . 4 ) .|Nitrofurantoins were associated with anophthalmia or microphthalmos ( AOR = 3 . 7 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 1 - 12 . 2 ) , hypoplastic left heart syndrome ( AOR = 4 . 2 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 9 - 9 . 1 ) , atrial septal defects ( AOR = 1 . 9 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 1 - 3 . 4 ) , and cleft lip with cleft palate ( AOR = 2 . 1 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 2 - 3 . 9 ) .|Other antibacterial agents that showed associations included erythromycins ( 2 defects ) , penicillins ( 1 defect ) , cephalosporins ( 1 defect ) , and quinolones ( 1 defect ) .|CONCLUSIONS : Reassuringly , penicillins , erythromycins , and cephalosporins , although used commonly by pregnant women , were not associated with many birth defects .|Sulfonamides and nitrofurantoins were associated with several birth defects , indicating a need for additional scrutiny .	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	465-466	462-464	D013449	Sulfonamides|Sulfonamides	Chemical	158:465	159:466	6:10	D000014	birth defects|Birth Defects|birth

3970039	Incidence of neoplasms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis exposed to different treatment regimens .|Immunosuppressive drugs have been used during the last 30 years in treatment of patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis .|The drugs commonly used are cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil ( alkylating agents ) , azathioprine ( purine analogue ) , and methotrexate ( folic acid analogue ) .|There is evidence that all four immunosuppressive drugs can reduce synovitis , but disease activity almost always recurs after therapy is stopped .|Since adverse reactions are frequent , less than 50 percent of patients are able to continue a particular drug for more than one year .|Since it takes three to 12 months to achieve maximal effects , those patients who are unable to continue the drug receive little benefit from it .|Patients treated with alkylating agents have an increased risk of development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia , and both alkylating agents and azathioprine are associated with the development of non - Hodgkin 's lymphoma .|Cyclophosphamide therapy increases the risk of carcinoma of the bladder .|There have been several long - term studies of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide and the incidence of most of the common cancers is not increased .|Data on the possible increased risk of malignancy in rheumatoid arthritis are still being collected , and until further information is available , the use of immunosuppressive drugs , particularly alkylating agents , in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis should be reserved for patients with severe progressive disease or life - threatening complications .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	206-207	197-198	D003520	cyclophosphamide|Cyclophosphamide|cyclophosphamide	Chemical	38:169:197	39:170:198	2:7:8	D009369	neoplasms|cancers|malignancy	Disease	2:206:218	3:207:219	0:8:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	40-41	2-3	D002699	chlorambucil	Chemical	40	41	2	D009369	neoplasms|cancers|malignancy	Disease	2:206:218	3:207:219	0:8:9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	241-243	218-219	D000477	alkylating agents|alkylating agents|alkylating agents|alkylating agents	Chemical	42:138:153:241	44:140:155:243	2:6:6:9	D009369	neoplasms|cancers|malignancy	Disease	2:206:218	3:207:219	0:8:9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	206-207	195-196	D001379	azathioprine|azathioprine|azathioprine	Chemical	46:156:195	47:157:196	2:6:8	D009369	neoplasms|cancers|malignancy	Disease	2:206:218	3:207:219	0:8:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	48-49	2-3	D011687	purine	Chemical	48	49	2	D009369	neoplasms|cancers|malignancy	Disease	2:206:218	3:207:219	0:8:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	53-54	2-3	D008727	methotrexate	Chemical	53	54	2	D009369	neoplasms|cancers|malignancy	Disease	2:206:218	3:207:219	0:8:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	55-57	2-3	D005492	folic acid	Chemical	55	57	2	D009369	neoplasms|cancers|malignancy	Disease	2:206:218	3:207:219	0:8:9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	197-198	191-193	D003520	cyclophosphamide|Cyclophosphamide|cyclophosphamide	Chemical	38:169:197	39:170:198	2:7:8	D001172	rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis	Disease	6:30:191:220:248	8:32:193:222:250	0:1:8:9:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	40-41	30-32	D002699	chlorambucil	Chemical	40	41	2	D001172	rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis	Disease	6:30:191:220:248	8:32:193:222:250	0:1:8:9:9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	248-250	241-243	D000477	alkylating agents|alkylating agents|alkylating agents|alkylating agents	Chemical	42:138:153:241	44:140:155:243	2:6:6:9	D001172	rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis	Disease	6:30:191:220:248	8:32:193:222:250	0:1:8:9:9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	195-196	191-193	D001379	azathioprine|azathioprine|azathioprine	Chemical	46:156:195	47:157:196	2:6:8	D001172	rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis	Disease	6:30:191:220:248	8:32:193:222:250	0:1:8:9:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	48-49	30-32	D011687	purine	Chemical	48	49	2	D001172	rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis	Disease	6:30:191:220:248	8:32:193:222:250	0:1:8:9:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	53-54	30-32	D008727	methotrexate	Chemical	53	54	2	D001172	rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis	Disease	6:30:191:220:248	8:32:193:222:250	0:1:8:9:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	55-57	30-32	D005492	folic acid	Chemical	55	57	2	D001172	rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis	Disease	6:30:191:220:248	8:32:193:222:250	0:1:8:9:9	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	38-39	70-71	D003520	cyclophosphamide|Cyclophosphamide|cyclophosphamide	Chemical	38:169:197	39:170:198	2:7:8	D013585	synovitis	Disease	70	71	3	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	147-150	169-170	D003520	cyclophosphamide|Cyclophosphamide|cyclophosphamide	Chemical	38:169:197	39:170:198	2:7:8	D015470	acute nonlymphocytic leukemia	Disease	147	150	6	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	163-168	169-170	D003520	cyclophosphamide|Cyclophosphamide|cyclophosphamide	Chemical	38:169:197	39:170:198	2:7:8	D008228	non -

8643971	A phase I / II study of paclitaxel plus cisplatin as first - line therapy for head and neck cancers : preliminary results .|Improved outcomes among patients with head and neck carcinomas require investigations of new drugs for induction therapy .|Preliminary results of an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study of single - agent paclitaxel ( Taxol ; Bristol - Myers Squibb Company , Princeton , NJ ) reported a 37 % response rate in patients with head and neck cancer , and the paclitaxel / cisplatin combination has been used successfully and has significantly improved median response duration in ovarian cancer patients .|We initiated a phase I / II trial to determine the response and toxicity of escalating paclitaxel doses combined with fixed - dose cisplatin with granulocyte colony - stimulating factor support in patients with untreated locally advanced inoperable head and neck carcinoma .|To date , 23 men with a median age of 50 years and good performance status have entered the trial .|Primary tumor sites were oropharynx , 10 patients ; hypopharynx , four ; larynx , two ; oral cavity , three ; unknown primary , two ; and nasal cavity and parotid gland , one each .|Of 20 patients evaluable for toxicity , four had stage III and 16 had stage IV disease .|Treatment , given every 21 days for a maximum of three cycles , consisted of paclitaxel by 3 - hour infusion followed the next day by a fixed dose of cisplatin ( 75 mg / m2 ) .|The dose levels incorporate escalating paclitaxel doses , and intrapatient escalations within a given dose level are permitted if toxicity permits .|At the time of this writing , dose level 4 ( 260 , 270 , and 280 mg / m2 ) is being evaluated ; three patients from this level are evaluable .|With paclitaxel doses of 200 mg / m2 and higher , granulocyte colony - stimulating factor 5 micrograms / kg / d is given ( days 4 through 12 ) .|Of 18 patients evaluable for response , seven ( 39 % ) achieved a complete response and six ( 33 % ) achieved a partial response .|Three patients had no change and disease progressed in two .|The overall response rate is 72 % .|Eleven responding patients had subsequent surgery / radiotherapy or radical radiotherapy .|Two pathologic complete responses were observed in patients who had achieved clinical complete responses .|Alopecia , paresthesias , and arthralgias / myalgias have occurred frequently , but with one exception ( a grade 3 myalgia ) they have been grade 1 or 2 .|No dose - limiting hematologic toxicity has been seen .|Paclitaxel / cisplatin is an effective first - line regimen for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer and continued study is warranted .|Results thus far suggest no dose -

2440413	Differential effects of gamma - hexachlorocyclohexane ( lindane ) on pharmacologically - induced seizures .|Gamma - hexachlorocyclohexane ( gamma - HCH ) , the active ingredient of the insecticide lindane , has been shown to decrease seizure threshold to pentylenetrazol ( PTZ ) 3 h after exposure to gamma - HCH and conversely increase threshold to PTZ - induced seizures 24 h after exposure to gamma - HCH ( Vohland et al . 1981 ) .|In this study , the severity of response to other seizure - inducing agents was tested in mice 1 and 24 h after intraperitoneal administration of 80 mg / kg gamma - HCH .|One hour after the administration of gamma - HCH , the activity of seizure - inducing agents was increased , regardless of their mechanism , while 24 h after gamma - HCH a differential response was observed .|Seizure activity due to PTZ and picrotoxin ( PTX ) was significantly decreased ; however , seizure activity due to 3 - mercaptopropionic acid ( MPA ) , bicuculline ( BCC ) , methyl 6 , 7 - dimethoxy - 4 - ethyl - B - carboline - 3 - carboxylate ( DMCM ) , or strychnine ( STR ) was not different from control .|In vitro , gamma - HCH , pentylenetetrazol and picrotoxin were shown to inhibit 3H - TBOB binding in mouse whole brain , with IC50 values of 4 . 6 , 404 and 9 . 4 microM , respectively .|MPA , BCC , DMCM , and STR showed no inhibition of 3H - TBOB ( t - butyl bicyclo - orthobenzoate ) binding at concentrations of 100 micron .|The pharmacological challenge data suggest that tolerance may occur to seizure activity induced by PTZ and PTX 24 h after gamma - HCH , since the response to only these two seizure - inducing agents is decreased .|The in vitro data suggest that the site responsible for the decrease in seizure activity 24 h after gamma - HCH may be the GABA - A receptor - linked chloride channel .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	13-14	15-18	D001556	gamma - hexachlorocyclohexane|lindane|Gamma - hexachlorocyclohexane|gamma - HCH|lindane|gamma - HCH|gamma - HCH|gamma - HCH|gamma - HCH|gamma - HCH|gamma - HCH|gamma - HCH|gamma - HCH	Chemical	3:7:15:19:30:49:66:107:117:140:218:305:341	6:8:18:22:31:52:69:110:120:143:221:308:344	0:0:1:1:1:1:1:2:3:3:5:7:8	D012640	seizures|seizure|seizures|seizure|seizure|Seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure	Disease	13:37:60:87:124:149:165:295:316:336	14:38:61:88:125:150:166:296:317:337	0:1:1:2:3:4:4:7:7:8	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	60-61	57-58	D010433	PTZ|PTZ|PTZ|pentylenetetrazol|PTZ	Chemical	42:57:153:222:299	43:58:154:223:300	1:1:4:5:7	D012640	seizures|seizure|seizures|seizure|seizure|Seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure	Disease	13:37:60:87:124:149:165:295:316:336	14:38:61:88:125:150:166:296:317:337	0:1:1:2:3:4:4:7:7:8	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	155-156	149-150	D010852	picrotoxin|PTX|picrotoxin|PTX	Chemical	155:157:224:301	156:158:225:302	4:4:5:7	D012640	seizures|seizure|seizures|seizure|seizure|Seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure	Disease	13:37:60:87:124:149:165:295:316:336	14:38:61:88:125:150:166:296:317:337	0:1:1:2:3:4:4:7:7:8	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	169-173	165-166	D015097	3 - mercaptopropionic acid|MPA|MPA	Chemical	169:174:255	173:175:256	4:4:6	D012640	seizures|seizure|seizures|seizure|seizure|Seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure	Disease	13:37:60:87:124:149:165:295:316:336	14:38:61:88:125:150:166:296:317:337	0:1:1:2:3:4:4:7:7:8	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	177-178	165-166	D001640	bicuculline|BCC|BCC	Chemical	177:179:257	178:180:258	4:4:6	D012640	seizures|seizure|seizures|seizure|seizure|Seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure	Disease	13:37:60:87:124:149:165:295:316:336	14:38:61:88:125:150:166:296:317:337	0:1:1:2:3:4:4:7:7:8	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	182-200	165-166	C034818	methyl 6 , 7 - dimethoxy - 4 - ethyl - B - carboline - 3 - carboxylate|DMCM|DMCM	Chemical	182:201:259	200:202:260	4:4:6	D012640	seizures|seizure|seizures|seizure|seizure|Seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure	Disease	13:37:60:87:124:149:165:295:316:336	14:38:61:88:125:150:166:296:317:337	0:1:1:2:3:4:4:7:7:8	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	295-296	262-263	D013331	strychnine|STR|STR	Chemical	205:207:262	206:208:263	4:4:6	D012640	seizures|seizure|seizures|seizure|seizure|Seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure	Disease	13:37:60:87:124:149:165:295:316:336	14:38:61:88:125:150:166:296:317:337	0:1:1:2:3:4:4:7:7:8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	295-296	271-277	C046308	3H - TBOB|3H - TBOB|t - butyl bicyclo - orthobenzoate	Chemical	229:267:271	232:270:277	5:6:6	D012640	seizures|seizure|seizures|seizure|seizure|Seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure	Disease	13:37:60:87:124:149:165:295:316:336	14:38:61:88:125:150:166:296:317:337	0:1:1:2:3:4:4:7:7:8	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	347-348	336-337	D005680	GABA	Chemical	347	348	8	D012640	seizures|seizure|seizures|seizure|seizure|Seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure	Disease	13:37:60:87:124:149:165:295:316:336	14:38:61:88:125:150:166:296:317:337	0:1:1:2:3:4:4:7:7:8
12483326	Severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas .|BACKGROUND : Glioblastoma is a malignant tumor that occurs in the cerebrum during adulthood .|With current treatment regimens including combined surgery , radiation and chemotherapy , the average life expectancy of the patients is limited to approximately 1 year .|Therefore , patients with glioblastoma sometimes have intracarotid injection of carcinostatics added to the treatment regimen .|Generally , carboplatin is said to have milder side effects than cisplatin , whose ocular and orbital toxicity are well known .|However , we experienced a case of severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin , which is infrequently reported .|CASE : A 58 - year - old man received an intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas in his left temporal lobe .|He complained of pain and visual disturbance in the ipsilateral eye 30 h after the injection .|Various ocular symptoms and findings caused by carboplatin toxicity were seen .|RESULTS : He was treated with intravenous administration of corticosteroids and glycerin for 6 days after the injection .|Although the intraocular pressure elevation caused by secondary acute angle - closure glaucoma decreased and ocular pain diminished , inexorable papilledema and exudative retinal detachment continued for 3 weeks .|Finally , 6 weeks later , diffuse chorioretinal atrophy with optic atrophy occurred and the vision in his left eye was lost .|CONCLUSION : When performing intracarotid injection of carboplatin , we must be aware of its potentially blinding ocular toxicity .|It is recommended that further studies and investigations are undertaken in the effort to minimize such severe side effects

18809400	Alpha - lipoic acid prevents mitochondrial damage and neurotoxicity in experimental chemotherapy neuropathy .|The study investigates if alpha - lipoic acid is neuroprotective against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity , if mitochondrial damage plays a critical role in toxic neurodegenerative cascade , and if neuroprotective effects of alpha - lipoic acid depend on mitochondria protection .|We used an in vitro model of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy that closely mimic the in vivo condition by exposing primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) sensory neurons to paclitaxel and cisplatin , two widely used and highly effective chemotherapeutic drugs .|This approach allowed investigating the efficacy of alpha - lipoic acid in preventing axonal damage and apoptosis and the function and ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria after exposure to toxic agents and alpha - lipoic acid .|Our results demonstrate that both cisplatin and paclitaxel cause early mitochondrial impairment with loss of membrane potential and induction of autophagic vacuoles in neurons .|Alpha - lipoic acid exerts neuroprotective effects against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity in sensory neurons : it rescues the mitochondrial toxicity and induces the expression of frataxin , an essential mitochondrial protein with anti - oxidant and chaperone properties .|In conclusion mitochondrial toxicity is an early common event both in paclitaxel and cisplatin induced neurotoxicity .|Alpha - lipoic acid protects sensory neurons through its anti - oxidant and mitochondrial regulatory functions , possibly inducing the expression of frataxin .|These findings suggest that alpha - lipoic acid might reduce the risk of developing peripheral nerve toxicity in patients undergoing chemotherapy and encourage further confirmatory clinical trials .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	0-4	5-7	D008063	Alpha -

17020434	Optimising stroke prevention in non - valvular atrial fibrillation .|Atrial fibrillation is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality .|Pooled data from trials comparing antithrombotic treatment with placebo have shown that warfarin reduces the risk of stroke by 62 % , and that aspirin alone reduces the risk by 22 % .|Overall , in high - risk patients , warfarin is superior to aspirin in preventing strokes , with a relative risk reduction of 36 % .|Ximelagatran , an oral direct thrombin inhibitor , was found to be as efficient as vitamin K antagonist drugs in the prevention of embolic events , but has been recently withdrawn because of abnormal liver function tests .|The ACTIVE - W ( Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events ) study has demonstrated that warfarin is superior to platelet therapy ( clopidogrel plus aspirin ) in the prevention af embolic events .|Idraparinux , a Factor Xa inhibitor , is being evaluated in patients with atrial fibrillation .|Angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor - blocking drugs hold promise in atrial fibrillation through cardiac remodelling .|Preliminary studies suggest that statins could interfere with the risk of recurrence after electrical cardioversion .|Finally , percutaneous methods for the exclusion of left atrial appendage are under investigation in high - risk patients

3629586	The hematologic effects of cefonicid and cefazedone in the dog : a potential model of cephalosporin hematotoxicity in man .|Cephalosporin antibiotics cause a variety of hematologic disturbances in man , the pathogeneses and hematopathology of which remain poorly characterized .|There is a need for a well - defined animal model in which these blood dyscrasias can be studied .|In four subacute toxicity studies , the intravenous administration of cefonicid or cefazedone to beagle dogs caused a dose - dependent incidence of anemia , neutropenia , and thrombocytopenia after 1 - 3 months of treatment .|A nonregenerative anemia was the most compromising of the cytopenias and occurred in approximately 50 % of dogs receiving 400 - 500 mg / kg cefonicid or 540 - 840 mg / kg cefazedone .|All three cytopenias were completely reversible following cessation of treatment ; the time required for recovery of the erythron ( approximately 1 month ) was considerably longer than that of the granulocytes and platelets ( hours to a few days ) .|Upon rechallenge with either cephalosporin , the hematologic syndrome was reproduced in most dogs tested ;

anaesthesia with sevoflurane , postoperative nausea and vomiting occurs frequently .|Fentanyl is a commonly used supplement that may contribute to this , although it may also improve analgesia .|METHODS : This double - blind study examined the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain in the first 24 h after sevoflurane anaesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients .|Patients were randomly allocated to either receive or not receive 1 1 fentanyl , while a third group received dexamethasone in addition to fentanyl .|RESULTS : Omission of fentanyl did not reduce the overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting , but did reduce the incidence of vomiting and / or moderate to severe nausea prior to discharge from 20 % and 17 % with fentanyl and fentanyl - dexamethasone , respectively , to 5 % ( P = 0 . 013 ) .|Antiemetic requirements were reduced from 24 % and 31 % to 7 % ( P = 0 . 0012 ) .|Dexamethasone had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting .|Combining the two fentanyl groups revealed further significant benefits from the avoidance of opioids , reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting and nausea prior to discharge from 35 % and 33 % to 22 % and 19 % ( P = 0 . 049 and P = 0 . 035 ) , respectively , while nausea in the first 24 h was decreased from 42 % to 27 % ( P = 0 . 034 ) .|Pain severity and analgesic requirements were unaffected by the omission of fentanyl .|Fentanyl did reduce minor intraoperative movement but had no sevoflurane - sparing effect and increased respiratory depression , hypotension and bradycardia .|CONCLUSION : As fentanyl exacerbated postoperative nausea and vomiting without an improvement in postoperative pain and also had adverse cardiorespiratory effects , it appears to be an unnecessary and possibly detrimental supplement to sevoflurane in day surgery

18186898	Renal Fanconi syndrome and myopathy after liver transplantation : drug - related mitochondrial cytopathy ?|Advances in the field of transplantation provide a better quality of life and allow more favorable conditions for growth and development in children .|However , combinations of different therapeutic regimens require consideration of potential adverse reactions .|We describe a 15 - yr - old girl who had orthotopic liver transplantation because of Wilson 's disease .|Tacrolimus , MMF , and steroids were given as immunosuppressant .|Lamivudine was added because of de nova hepatitis B infection during her follow - up .|Three yr after transplantation she developed renal Fanconi syndrome with severe metabolic acidosis , hypophosphatemia , glycosuria , and aminoaciduria .|Although tacrolimus was suspected to be the cause of late post - transplant renal acidosis and was replaced by sirolimus , acidosis , and electrolyte imbalance got worse .|Proximal muscle weakness has developed during her follow - up .|Fanconi syndrome , as well as myopathy , is well recognized in patients with mitochondrial disorders and caused by depletion of mtDNA .|We suggest that our patient 's tubular dysfunction and myopathy may have resulted from mitochondrial dysfunction which is triggered by tacrolimus and augmented by lamivudine

16867021	Antipsychotic - like profile of thioperamide , a selective H3 - receptor antagonist in mice .|Experimental and clinical evidence points to a role of central histaminergic system in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia .|The present study was designed to study the effect of histamine H ( 3 ) - receptor ligands on neuroleptic - induced catalepsy , apomorphine - induced climbing behavior and amphetamine - induced locomotor activities in mice .|Catalepsy was induced by haloperidol ( 2 mg / kg p . o . ) , while apomorphine ( 1 . 5 mg / kg s . c . ) and amphetamine ( 2 mg / kg s . c . ) were used for studying climbing behavior and locomotor activities , respectively .|( R ) - alpha - methylhistamine ( RAMH ) ( 5 microg i . c . v . ) and thioperamide ( THP ) ( 15 mg / kg i . p . ) , per se did not cause catalepsy .|Administration of THP ( 3 . 75 , 7 . 5 and 15 mg / kg i . p . ) 1 h prior to haloperidol resulted in a dose - dependent increase in the catalepsy times ( P < 0 . 05 ) .|However , pretreatment with RAMH significantly reversed such an effect of THP ( 15 mg / kg i . p . ) .|RAMH per se showed significant reduction in locomotor time , distance traveled and average speed but THP ( 15 mg / kg i . p . ) per se had no effect on these parameters .|On amphetamine - induced hyperactivity , THP ( 3 . 75 and 7 . 5 mg / kg i . p . ) reduced locomotor time , distance traveled and average speed ( P < 0 . 05 ) .|Pretreatment with RAMH ( 5 microg i . c . v . ) could partially reverse such effects of THP ( 3 . 75 mg / kg i . p . ) .|Climbing behavior induced by apomorphine was reduced in animals treated with THP .|Such an effect was , however , reversed in presence of RAMH .|THP exhibited an antipsychotic - like profile by potentiating haloperidol - induced catalepsy , reducing amphetamine - induced hyperactivity and reducing apomorphine - induced climbing in mice .|Such effects of THP were reversed by RAMH indicating the involvement of histamine H ( 3 ) - receptors .|Findings suggest a potential for H ( 3 ) - receptor antagonists in improving the refractory cases of schizophrenia .	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	5-6	32-33	C052075	thioperamide|thioperamide|THP|THP|THP|THP|THP|THP|THP|THP|THP	Chemical	5:147:149:171:225:253:279:332:357:372:403	6:148:150:172:226:254:280:333:358:373:404	0:4:4:5:6:7:8:9:10:12:13	D012559	schizophrenia|schizophrenia	Disease	32:438	33:439	1:14	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	167-168	171-172	C052075	thioperamide|thioperamide|THP|THP|THP|THP|THP|THP|THP|THP|THP	Chemical	5:147:149:171:225:253:279:332:357:372:403	6:148:150:172:226:254:280:333:358:373:404	0:4:4:5:6:7:8:9:10:12:13	D002375	catalepsy|Catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy	Disease	56:72:167:204:384	57:73:168:205:385	2:3:4:5:12	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	277-278	279-280	C052075	thioperamide|thioperamide|THP|THP|THP|THP|THP|THP|THP|THP|THP	Chemical	5:147:149:171:225:253:279:332:357:372:403	6:148:150:172:226:254:280:333:358:373:404	0:4:4:5:6:7:8:9:10:12:13	D006948	hyperactivity|hyperactivity	Disease	277:390	278:391	8:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	44-45	32-33	D006632	histamine|histamine	Chemical	44:412	45:413	2:13	D012559	schizophrenia|schizophrenia	Disease	32:438	33:439	1:14	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	58-59	32-33	D001058	apomorphine|apomorphine|apomorphine|apomorphine	Chemical	58:89:350:393	59:90:351:394	2:3:10:12	D012559	schizophrenia|schizophrenia	Disease	32:438	33:439	1:14	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	64-65	32-33	D000661	amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine	Chemical	64:103:274:387	65:104:275:388	2:3:8:12	D012559	schizophrenia|schizophrenia	Disease	32:438	33:439	1:14	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	76-77	32-33	D006220	haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol	Chemical	76:194:381	77:195:382	3:5:12	D012559	schizophrenia|schizophrenia	Disease	32:438	33:439	1:14	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	438-439	407-408	C069357	( R ) -

response effect has been observed with cisplatin , the dose - limiting toxicities associated with cisplatin ( e . g . , nephrotoxicity , ototoxicity , and neurotoxicity ) have limited its use as a treatment for breast carcinoma .|WR - 2721 or amifostine initially was developed to protect military personnel in the event of nuclear war .|Amifostine subsequently was shown to protect normal tissues from the toxic effects of alkylating agents and cisplatin without decreasing the antitumor effect of the chemotherapy .|Early trials of cisplatin and amifostine also suggested that the incidence and severity of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity , ototoxicity , and neuropathy were reduced .|METHODS : A Phase II study of the combination of cisplatin plus amifostine was conducted in patients with progressive metastatic breast carcinoma who had received one , but not more than one , chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease .|Patients received amifostine , 910 mg / m2 intravenously over 15 minutes .|After completion of the amifostine infusion , cisplatin 120 mg / m2 was administered over 30 minutes .|Intravenous hydration and mannitol was administered before and after cisplatin .|Treatment was administered every 3 weeks until disease progression .|RESULTS : Forty - four patients were enrolled in the study of which 7 ( 16 % ) were ineligible .|A median of 2 cycles of therapy was administered to the 37 eligible patients .|Six partial responses were observed for an overall response rate of 16 % .|Most patients ( 57 % ) stopped treatment because of disease progression .|Neurologic toxicity was reported in 52 % of patients .|Seven different life - threatening toxicities were observed in patients while receiving treatment .|CONCLUSIONS : The combination of cisplatin and amifostine in this study resulted in an overall response rate of 16 % .|Neither a tumor - protective effect nor reduced toxicity to normal tissues was observed with the addition of amifostine to cisplatin in this trial .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	5-6	15-17	D002945	cisplatin|Cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	5:30:68:87:96:156:169:180:202:251:271:375:411	6:31:69:88:97:157:170:181:203:252:272:376:412	0:1:2:3:3:5:6:6:7:9:10:18:19	D001943	breast carcinoma|breast carcinoma|breast carcinoma|breast carcinoma	Disease	15:47:118:212	17:49:120:214	0:1:3:7	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	93-94	96-97	D002945	cisplatin|Cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	5:30:68:87:96:156:169:180:202:251:271:375:411	6:31:69:88:97:157:170:181:203:252:272:376:412	0:1:2:3:3:5:6:6:7:9:10:18:19	D064420	toxicities|toxicities|toxicity	Disease	93:361:399	94:362:400	3:17:19	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	180-181	183-184	D002945	cisplatin|Cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	5:30:68:87:96:156:169:180:202:251:271:375:411	6:31:69:88:97:157:170:181:203:252:272:376:412	0:1:2:3:3:5:6:6:7:9:10:18:19	D007674	nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxicity	Disease	103:183	104:184	3:6	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	180-181	185-186	D002945	cisplatin|Cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	5:30:68:87:96:156:169:180:202:251:271:375:411	6:31:69:88:97:157:170:181:203:252:272:376:412	0:1:2:3:3:5:6:6:7:9:10:18:19	D006311	ototoxicity|ototoxicity	Disease	105:185	106:186	3:6	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	96-97	108-109	D002945	cisplatin|Cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	5:30:68:87:96:156:169:180:202:251:271:375:411	6:31:69:88:97:157:170:181:203:252:272:376:412	0:1:2:3:3:5:6:6:7:9:10:18:19	D020258	neurotoxicity|Neurologic toxicity	Disease	108:346	109:348	3:16	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	180-181	188-189	D002945	cisplatin|Cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	5:30:68:87:96:156:169:180:202:251:271:375:411	6:31:69:88:97:157:170:181:203:252:272:376:412	0:1:2:3:3:5:6:6:7:9:10:18:19	D009422	neuropathy	Disease	188	189	6	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	375-376	393-394	D002945	cisplatin|Cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	5:30:68:87:96:156:169:180:202:251:271:375:411	6:31:69:88:97:157:170:181:203:252:272:376:412	0:1:2:3:3:5:6:6:7:9:10:18:19	D009369	tumor	Disease	393	394	19	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	118-120	121-124	D004999	WR -

15899738	Lone atrial fibrillation associated with creatine monohydrate supplementation .|Atrial fibrillation in young patients without structural heart disease is rare .|Therefore , when the arrhythmia is present in this population , reversible causes must be identified and resolved .|Thyroid disorders , illicit drug or stimulant use , and acute alcohol intoxication are among these causes .|We report the case of a 30 - year - old Caucasian man who came to the emergency department in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response .|His medical history was unremarkable , except for minor fractures of the fingers and foot .|Thyroid - stimulating hormone , magnesium , and potassium levels were within normal limits , urine drug screen was negative , and alcohol use was denied .|However , when the patient was questioned about use of herbal products and supplements , the use of creatine monohydrate was revealed .|The patient was admitted to the hospital , anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin , and given intravenous diltiazem for rate control and intravenous amiodarone for rate and rhythm control .|When discharged less than 24 hours later , he was receiving metoprolol and aspirin , with follow - up plans for echocardiography and nuclear imaging to assess perfusion .|Exogenous creatine is used by athletes to theoretically improve exercise performance .|Vegetarians may also take creatine to replace what they are not consuming from meat , fish , and other animal products .|Previous anecdotal reports have linked creatine to the development of arrhythmia .|Clinicians must be diligent when interviewing patients about their drug therapy histories and include questions about their use of herbal products and dietary supplements .|In addition , it is important to report adverse effects associated with frequently consumed supplements and herbal products to the Food and Drug Administration and in the literature

15863244	Comparison of developmental toxicity of selective and non - selective cyclooxygenase - 2 inhibitors in CRL : ( WI ) WUBR Wistar rats - - DFU and piroxicam study .|BACKGROUND : Cyclooxygenase ( COX ) inhibitors are one of the most often ingested drugs during pregnancy .|Unlike general toxicity data , their prenatal toxic effects were not extensively studied before .|The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the developmental toxicity of the non - selective ( piroxicam ) and selective ( DFU ; 5 , 5 - dimethyl - 3 - ( 3 - fluorophenyl ) - 4 - ( 4 - methylsulphonyl ) phenyl - 2 ( 5H ) - furanon ) COX - 2 inhibitors .|METHODS : Drugs were separately , orally once daily dosed to pregnant rats from day 8 to 21 ( GD1 = plug day ) .|Doses were set at 0 . 3 , 3 . 0 and 30 . 0mg / kg for piroxicam and 0 . 2 , 2 . 0 and 20 . 0mg / kg for DFU .|Fetuses were delivered on GD 21 and routinely examined .|Comprehensive clinical and developmental measurements were done .|The pooled statistical analysis for ventricular septal ( VSD ) and midline ( MD ) defects was performed for rat fetuses exposed to piroxicam , selective and non - selective COX - 2 inhibitor based on present and historic data .|RESULTS : Maternal toxicity , intrauterine growth retardation , and increase of external and skeletal variations were found in rats treated with the highest dose of piroxicam .|Decrease of fetal length was the only signs of the DFU developmental toxicity observed in pups exposed to the highest compound dose .|Lack of teratogenicity was found in piroxicam and DFU - exposed groups .|Prenatal exposure to non - selective COX inhibitors increases the risk of VSD and MD when compared to historic control but not with selective COX - 2 inhibitors .|CONCLUSION : Both selective and non - selective COX - 2 inhibitors were toxic for rats fetuses when administered in the highest dose .|Unlike DFU , piroxicam was also highly toxic to the dams .|Prenatal exposure to selective COX - 2 inhibitors does not increase the risk of ventricular septal and midline defects in rat when compared to non - selective drugs and historic control .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	282-283	280-281	C106876	DFU|DFU|5 , 5 - dimethyl - 3 - ( 3 - fluorophenyl ) - 4 - ( 4 - methylsulphonyl ) phenyl - 2 ( 5H ) - furanon|DFU|DFU|DFU|DFU	Chemical	25:85:87:181:280:301:360	26:86:116:182:281:302:361	0:3:3:5:10:11:14	D064420	toxicity|toxicity|toxicity|toxicity|toxicity	Disease	3:50:73:245:282	4:51:74:246:283	0:2:3:9:10	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	80-81	73-74	D010894	piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam	Chemical	27:80:165:224:268:299:362	28:81:166:225:269:300:363	0:3:5:8:9:11:14	D064420	toxicity|toxicity|toxicity|toxicity|toxicity	Disease	3:50:73:245:282	4:51:74:246:283	0:2:3:9:10	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	181-182	206-217	C106876	DFU|DFU|5 , 5 - dimethyl - 3 - ( 3 - fluorophenyl ) - 4 - ( 4 - methylsulphonyl ) phenyl - 2 ( 5H ) - furanon|DFU|DFU|DFU|DFU	Chemical	25:85:87:181:280:301:360	26:86:116:182:281:302:361	0:3:3:5:10:11:14	D006345	ventricular septal ( VSD ) and midline ( MD ) defects|ventricular septal and midline defects	Disease	206:385	217:390	8:15	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	181-182	206-217	C106876	DFU|DFU|5 , 5 - dimethyl - 3 - ( 3 - fluorophenyl ) - 4 - ( 4 - methylsulphonyl ) phenyl - 2 ( 5H ) - furanon|DFU|DFU|DFU|DFU	Chemical	25:85:87:181:280:301:360	26:86:116:182:281:302:361	0:3:3:5:10:11:14	D009436	ventricular septal ( VSD ) and midline ( MD ) defects|ventricular septal and midline defects	Disease	206:385	217:390	8:15	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	247-250	280-281	C106876	DFU|DFU|5 , 5 - dimethyl - 3 - ( 3 - fluorophenyl ) - 4 - ( 4 - methylsulphonyl ) phenyl - 2 ( 5H ) - furanon|DFU|DFU|DFU|DFU	Chemical	25:85:87:181:280:301:360	26:86:116:182:281:302:361	0:3:3:5:10:11:14	D005317	intrauterine growth retardation	Disease	247	250	9	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	252-258	280-281	C106876	DFU|DFU|5 , 5 - dimethyl - 3 - ( 3 - fluorophenyl ) - 4 - ( 4 - methylsulphonyl ) phenyl - 2 ( 5H ) - furanon|DFU|DFU|DFU|DFU	Chemical	25:85:87:181:280:301:360	26:86:116:182:281:302:361	0:3:3:5:10:11:14	D009139	increase of external and skeletal variations	Disease	252	258	9	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	206-217	224-225	D010894	piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam	Chemical	27:80:165:224:268:299:362	28:81:166:225:269:300:363	0:3:5:8:9:11:14	D006345	ventricular septal ( VSD ) and midline ( MD ) defects|ventricular septal and midline defects	Disease	206:385	217:390	8:15	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	206-217	224-225	D010894	piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam	Chemical	27:80:165:224:268:299:362	28:81:166:225:269:300:363	0:3:5:8:9:11:14	D009436	ventricular septal ( VSD ) and midline ( MD ) defects|ventricular septal and midline defects	Disease	206:385	217:390	8:15	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	247-250	268-269	D010894	piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam	Chemical	27:80:165:224:268:299:362	28:81:166:225:269:300:363	0:3:5:8:9:11:14	D005317	intrauterine growth retardation	Disease	247	250	9	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	252-258	268-269	D010894	piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam|piroxicam	Chemical	27:80:165:224:268:299:362	28:81:166:225:269:300:363	0:3:5:8:9:11:14	D009139	increase of external and skeletal variations	Disease	252	258	9
12921865	Protective efficacy of neuroactive steroids against cocaine kindled - seizures in mice .|Neuroactive steroids demonstrate pharmacological actions that have relevance for a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders .|They offer protection against seizures in a range of models and seem to inhibit certain stages of drug dependence in preclinical assessments .|The present study was designed to evaluate two endogenous and one synthetic neuroactive steroid that positively modulate the gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ( A ) ) receptor against the increase in sensitivity to the convulsant effects of cocaine engendered by repeated cocaine administration ( seizure kindling ) .|Allopregnanolone ( 3alpha - hydroxy - 5alpha - pregnan - 20 - one ) , pregnanolone ( 3alpha - hydroxy - 5beta - pregnan - 20 - one ) and ganaxolone ( a synthetic derivative of allopregnanolone 3alpha - hydroxy - 3beta - methyl - 5alpha - pregnan - 20 - one ) were tested for their ability to suppress the expression ( anticonvulsant effect ) and development ( antiepileptogenic effect ) of cocaine - kindled seizures in male , Swiss - Webster mice .|Kindled seizures were induced by daily administration of 60 mg / kg cocaine for 5 days .|All of these positive GABA ( A ) modulators suppressed the expression of kindled seizures , whereas only allopregnanolone and ganaxolone inhibited the development of kindling .|Allopregnanolone and pregnanolone , but not ganaxolone , also reduced cumulative lethality associated with kindling .|These findings demonstrate that some neuroactive steroids attenuate convulsant and sensitizing properties of cocaine and add to a growing literature on their potential use in the modulation of effects of drugs of abuse .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	4-5	9-10	D013256	steroids|steroids|steroid|steroids	Chemical	4:14:66:254	5:15:67:255	0:1:3:8	D012640	seizures|seizures|seizure|seizures|seizures|seizures	Disease	9:34:99:179:189:219	10:35:100:180:190:220	0:2:3:4:5:6	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	14-15	25-29	D013256	steroids|steroids|steroid|steroids	Chemical	4:14:66:254	5:15:67:255	0:1:3:8	D009422	neurological and psychiatric disorders	Disease	25	29	1	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	14-15	25-29	D013256	steroids|steroids|steroid|steroids	Chemical	4:14:66:254	5:15:67:255	0:1:3:8	D001523	neurological and psychiatric disorders	Disease	25	29	1	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	47-49	66-67	D013256	steroids|steroids|steroid|steroids	Chemical	4:14:66:254	5:15:67:255	0:1:3:8	D019966	drug dependence	Disease	47	49	2	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	6-7	9-10	D003042	cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine	Chemical	6:92:96:176:200:261	7:93:97:177:201:262	0:3:3:4:5:8	D012640	seizures|seizures|seizure|seizures|seizures|seizures	Disease	9:34:99:179:189:219	10:35:100:180:190:220	0:2:3:4:5:6	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	6-7	25-29	D003042	cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine	Chemical	6:92:96:176:200:261	7:93:97:177:201:262	0:3:3:4:5:8	D009422	neurological and psychiatric disorders	Disease	25	29	1	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	6-7	25-29	D003042	cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine	Chemical	6:92:96:176:200:261	7:93:97:177:201:262	0:3:3:4:5:8	D001523	neurological and psychiatric disorders	Disease	25	29	1	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	6-7	47-49	D003042	cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine	Chemical	6:92:96:176:200:261	7:93:97:177:201:262	0:3:3:4:5:8	D019966	drug dependence	Disease	47	49	2	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	219-220	209-210	D005680	gamma -

12584269	Kidney function and morphology after short - term combination therapy with cyclosporine A , tacrolimus and sirolimus in the rat .|BACKGROUND : Sirolimus ( SRL ) may supplement calcineurin inhibitors in clinical organ transplantation .|These are nephrotoxic , but SRL seems to act differently displaying only minor nephrotoxic effects , although this question is still open .|In a number of treatment protocols where SRL was combined with a calcineurin inhibitor indications of a synergistic nephrotoxic effect were described .|The aim of this study was to examine further the renal function , including morphological analysis of the kidneys of male Sprague - Dawley rats treated with either cyclosporine A ( CsA ) , tacrolimus ( FK506 ) or SRL as monotherapies or in different combinations .|METHODS : For a period of 2 weeks , CsA 15 mg / kg / day ( given orally ) , FK506 3 . 0 mg / kg / day ( given orally ) or SRL 0 . 4 mg / kg / day ( given intraperitoneally ) was administered once a day as these doses have earlier been found to achieve a significant immunosuppressive effect in Sprague - Dawley rats .|In the ' conscious catheterized rat ' model , the glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) was measured as the clearance of Cr ( EDTA ) .|The morphological analysis of the kidneys included a semi - quantitative scoring system analysing the degree of striped fibrosis , subcapsular fibrosis and the number of basophilic tubules , plus an additional stereological analysis of the total grade of fibrosis in the cortex stained with Sirius Red .|RESULTS : CsA , FK506 and SRL all significantly decreased the GFR .|A further deterioration was seen when CsA was combined with either FK506 or SRL , whereas the GFR remained unchanged in the group treated with FK506 plus SRL when compared with treatment with any of the single substances .|The morphological changes presented a similar pattern .|The semi - quantitative scoring was significantly worst in the group treated with CsA plus SRL ( P < 0 . 001 compared with controls ) and the analysis of the total grade of fibrosis also showed the highest proportion in the same group and was significantly different from controls ( P < 0 . 02 ) .|The FK506 plus SRL combination showed only a marginally higher degree of fibrosis as compared with controls ( P = 0 . 05 ) .|CONCLUSION : This rat study demonstrated a synergistic nephrotoxic effect of CsA plus SRL , whereas FK506 plus SRL was better tolerated .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	427-428	430-431	D016572	cyclosporine A|cyclosporine A|CsA|CsA|CsA|CsA|CsA|CsA	Chemical	11:110:113:138:278:295:349:430	13:112:114:139:279:296:350:431	0:4:4:5:8:9:11:13	D007674	nephrotoxic|nephrotoxic|nephrotoxic|nephrotoxic	Disease	38:49:77:427	39:50:78:428	2:2:3:13	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	267-268	278-279	D016572	cyclosporine A|cyclosporine A|CsA|CsA|CsA|CsA|CsA|CsA	Chemical	11:110:113:138:278:295:349:430	13:112:114:139:279:296:350:431	0:4:4:5:8:9:11:13	D005355	fibrosis|fibrosis|fibrosis|fibrosis|fibrosis	Disease	246:249:267:370:406	247:250:268:371:407	7:7:7:11:12	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	427-428	435-436	D016559	tacrolimus|tacrolimus|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506	Chemical	14:116:118:150:280:300:314:395:435	15:117:119:151:281:301:315:396:436	0:4:4:5:8:9:9:12:13	D007674	nephrotoxic|nephrotoxic|nephrotoxic|nephrotoxic	Disease	38:49:77:427	39:50:78:428	2:2:3:13	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	395-396	406-407	D016559	tacrolimus|tacrolimus|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506|FK506	Chemical	14:116:118:150:280:300:314:395:435	15:117:119:151:281:301:315:396:436	0:4:4:5:8:9:9:12:13	D005355	fibrosis|fibrosis|fibrosis|fibrosis|fibrosis	Disease	246:249:267:370:406	247:250:268:371:407	7:7:7:11:12	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	38-39	41-42	D020123	sirolimus|Sirolimus|SRL|SRL|SRL|SRL|SRL|SRL|SRL|SRL|SRL|SRL|SRL|SRL	Chemical	16:23:25:41:66:121:164:282:302:316:351:397:432:437	17:24:26:42:67:122:165:283:303:317:352:398:433:438	0:1:1:2:3:4:5:8:9:9:11:12:13:13	D007674	nephrotoxic|nephrotoxic|nephrotoxic|nephrotoxic	Disease	38:49:77:427	39:50:78:428	2:2:3:13	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	397-398	406-407	D020123	sirolimus|Sirolimus|SRL|SRL|SRL|SRL|SRL|SRL|SRL|SRL|SRL|SRL|SRL|SRL	Chemical	16:23:25:41:66:121:164:282:302:316:351:397:432:437	17:24:26:42:67:122:165:283:303:317:352:398:433:438	0:1:1:2:3:4:5:8:9:9:11:12:13:13	D005355	fibrosis|fibrosis|fibrosis|fibrosis|fibrosis	Disease	246:249:267:370:406	247:250:268:371:407	7:7:7:11:12

19445921	Cardioprotective effect of salvianolic acid A on isoproterenol - induced myocardial infarction in rats .|The present study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective potential of salvianolic acid A on isoproterenol - induced myocardial infarction in rats .|Hemodynamic parameters and lead II electrocardiograph were monitored and recorded continuously .|Cardiac marker enzymes and antioxidative parameters in serum and heart tissues were measured .|Assay for mitochondrial respiratory function and histopathological examination of heart tissues were performed .|Isoproterenol - treated rats showed significant increases in the levels of lactate dehydrogenase , aspartate transaminase , creatine kinase and malondialdehyde and significant decreases in the activities of superoxide dismutase , catalase and glutathione peroxidase in serum and heart .|These rats also showed declines in left ventricular systolic pressure , maximum and minimum rate of developed left ventricular pressure , and elevation of left ventricular end - diastolic pressure and ST - segment .|In addition , mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction characterized by decreased respiratory control ratio and ADP / O was observed in isoproterenol - treated rats .|Administration of salvianolic acid A for a period of 8 days significantly attenuated isoproterenol - induced cardiac dysfunction and myocardial injury and improved mitochondrial respiratory function .|The protective role of salvianolic acid A against isoproterenol - induced myocardial damage was further confirmed by histopathological examination .|The results of our study suggest that salvianolic acid A possessing antioxidant activity has a significant protective effect against isoproterenol - induced myocardial

18439803	Acute effects of N - ( 2 - propylpentanoyl ) urea on hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters in pilocarpine - induced seizure in rats .|The present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant activity as well as the effects on the level of hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters ( glutamate , aspartate , glycine and GABA ) of N - ( 2 - propylpentanoyl ) urea ( VPU ) in comparison to its parent compound , valproic acid ( VPA ) .|VPU was more potent than VPA , exhibiting the median effective dose ( ED ( 50 ) ) of 49 mg / kg in protecting rats against pilocarpine - induced seizure whereas the corresponding value for VPA was 322 mg / kg .|In vivo microdialysis demonstrated that an intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine induced a pronounced increment of hippocampal glutamate and aspartate whereas no significant change was observed on the level of glycine and GABA .|Pretreatment with either VPU ( 50 and 100 mg / kg ) or VPA ( 300 and 600 mg / kg ) completely abolished pilocarpine - evoked increases in extracellular glutamate and aspartate .|In addition , a statistically significant reduction was also observed on the level of GABA and glycine but less than a drastic reduction of glutamate and aspartate level .|Based on the finding that VPU and VPA could protect the animals against pilocarpine - induced seizure it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of glutamate and aspartate .|Therefore , like VPA , the finding that VPU could drastically reduce pilocarpine - induced increases in glutamate and aspartate should account , at least partly , for its anticonvulsant activity observed in pilocarpine - induced seizure in experimental animals .|Some other mechanism than those being reported herein should be further investigated .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	3-11	20-21	C108761	N - ( 2 - propylpentanoyl ) urea|N - ( 2 - propylpentanoyl ) urea|VPU|VPU|VPU|VPU|VPU	Chemical	3:56:65:80:159:224:269	11:64:66:81:160:225:270	0:1:1:2:4:6:7	D012640	seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure	Disease	20:110:235:297	21:111:236:298	0:2:6:7	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	13-15	20-21	D000596	amino acid|amino acid|amino acid	Chemical	13:43:244	15:45:246	0:1:6	D012640	seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure	Disease	20:110:235:297	21:111:236:298	0:2:6:7	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	17-18	20-21	D010862	pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine	Chemical	17:107:132:180:232:273:294	18:108:133:181:233:274:295	0:2:3:4:6:7:7	D012640	seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure	Disease	20:110:235:297	21:111:236:298	0:2:6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	297-298	278-279	D018698	glutamate|glutamate|glutamate|glutamate|glutamate|glutamate	Chemical	47:139:186:214:257:278	48:140:187:215:258:279	1:3:4:5:6:7	D012640	seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure	Disease	20:110:235:297	21:111:236:298	0:2:6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	297-298	280-281	D001224	aspartate|aspartate|aspartate|aspartate|aspartate|aspartate	Chemical	49:141:188:216:259:280	50:142:189:217:260:281	1:3:4:5:6:7	D012640	seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure	Disease	20:110:235:297	21:111:236:298	0:2:6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	235-236	206-207	D005998	glycine|glycine|glycine	Chemical	51:152:206	52:153:207	1:3:5	D012640	seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure	Disease	20:110:235:297	21:111:236:298	0:2:6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	235-236	204-205	D005680	GABA|GABA|GABA	Chemical	53:154:204	54:155:205	1:3:5	D012640	seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure	Disease	20:110:235:297	21:111:236:298	0:2:6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	116-117	110-111	D014635	valproic acid|VPA|VPA|VPA|VPA|VPA|VPA	Chemical	74:77:85:116:169:226:264	76:78:86:117:170:227:265	1:1:2:2:4:6:7	D012640	seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure	Disease	20:110:235:297	21:111:236:298	0:2:6:7
17919553	Acute hepatitis attack after exposure to telithromycin .|INTRODUCTION : Antibiotic - associated hepatotoxicity is rare .|With widespread use of antimicrobial agents , however , hepatic injury occurs frequently , and among adverse drug reactions , idiosyncratic reactions are the most serious .|CASE SUMMARY : A 25 - year - old male patient , with a height of 175 cm and weight of 72 kg presented to Marmara University Hospital Emergency Department , Istanbul , Turkey , with 5 days ' history of jaundice , malaise , nausea , and vomiting .|He had been prescribed telithromycin 400 mg / d PO to treat an upper respiratory tract infection 7 days prior .|Admission laboratory tests were as follows : alanine aminotransferase , 67 U / L ( reference range , 10 - 37 U / L ) ; aspartate aminotransferase , 98 U / L ( 10 - 40 U / L ) ; alkaline phosphatase , 513 U / L ( 0 - 270 U / L ) ; gamma - glutamyltransferase , 32 U / L ( 7 - 49 U / L ) ; amylase , 46 U / L ( 0 - 220 U / L ) ; total bilirubin , 20 . 1 mg / dL ( 0 . 2 - 1 . 0 mg / dL ) ; direct bilirubin , 14 . 8 mg / dL ( 0 - 0 . 3 mg / dL ) ; and albumin , 4 . 7 mg / dL ( 3 . 5 - 5 . 4 mg / dL ) .|No toxin , alcohol , or other drugs were reported .|The patient had suffered a previous episode of " acute hepatitis of unknown origin , " that occurred after telithromycin usage .|Both incidents occurred within a year .|DISCUSSION : Telithromycin is the first of the ketolide antibacterials to receive US Food and Drug Administration approval for clinical use .|It has been associated with infrequent and usually reversible severe hepatic dysfunction .|Based on a score of 8 on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale , telithromycin was the probable cause of acute hepatitis in this patient , and pathological findings suggested drug - induced toxic hepatitis .|Recurrence of hepatitis attack might have been avoided if the initial incident had been communicated to the attending physician who prescribed telithromycin the second time .|CONCLUSION : Here we report a case of acute hepatitis probably associated with the administration of telithromycin .	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	6-7	1-2	C106791	telithromycin|telithromycin|telithromycin|Telithromycin|telithromycin|telithromycin|telithromycin	Chemical	6:98:299:311:359:402:423	7:99:300:312:360:403:424	0:4:7:9:11:12:13	D056486	hepatitis|hepatotoxicity|hepatic

15632880	Spironolactone - induced renal insufficiency and hyperkalemia in patients with heart failure .|BACKGROUND : A previous randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of spironolactone in heart failure patients reported a low risk of hyperkalemia ( 2 % ) and renal insufficiency ( 0 % ) .|Because treatments for heart failure have changed since the benefits of spironolactone were reported , the prevalence of these complications may differ in current clinical practice .|We therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency in heart failure patients treated with spironolactone .|METHODS : We performed a case control study of heart failure patients treated with spironolactone in our clinical practice .|Cases were patients who developed hyperkalemia ( K ( + ) > 5 . 0 mEq / L ) or renal insufficiency ( Cr > or = 2 . 5 mg / dL ) , and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per case .|Clinical characteristics , medications , and serum chemistries at baseline and follow - up time periods were compared .|RESULTS : Sixty - seven of 926 patients ( 7 . 2 % ) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia ( n = 33 ) or renal failure ( n = 34 ) .|Patients who developed hyperkalemia were older and more likely to have diabetes , had higher baseline serum potassium levels and lower baseline potassium supplement doses , and were more likely to be treated with beta -

17437408	Upregulation of brain expression of P - glycoprotein in MRP2 - deficient TR ( - ) rats resembles seizure - induced up - regulation of this drug efflux transporter in normal rats .|PURPOSE : The multidrug resistance protein 2 ( MRP2 ) is a drug efflux transporter that is expressed predominantly at the apical domain of hepatocytes but seems also to be expressed at the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) .|MRP2 is absent in the transport - deficient ( TR ( - ) ) Wistar rat mutant , so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of MRP2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in MRP2 - deficient rats with those in transport - competent Wistar rats .|By using this strategy to study the involvement of MRP2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs ) , we recently reported that phenytoin is a substrate for MRP2 in the BBB .|However , one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur .|This prompted us to study the brain expression of P - glycoprotein ( Pgp ) , a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues , including the BBB , in TR ( - ) rats compared with nonmutant ( wild - type ) Wistar rats .|METHODS : The expression of MRP2 and Pgp in brain and liver sections of TR ( - ) rats and normal Wistar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry , by using a novel , highly selective monoclonal MRP2 antibody and the monoclonal Pgp antibody C219 , respectively .|RESULTS : Immunofluorescence staining with the MRP2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal Wistar rats , whereas such labeling was absent in TR ( - ) rats .|TR ( - ) rats exhibited a significant up - regulation of Pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild - type controls .|No such obvious upregulation of Pgp was observed in liver sections .|A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after pilocarpine - induced seizures in wild - type Wistar rats .|Experiments with systemic administration of the Pgp substrate phenobarbital and the selective Pgp inhibitor tariquidar in TR ( - ) rats substantiated that Pgp is functional and compensates for the lack of MRP2 in the BBB .|CONCLUSIONS : The data on TR ( - ) rats indicate that Pgp plays an important role in the compensation of MRP2 deficiency in the BBB .|Because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce injury to the brain from cytotoxic compounds , the present data substantiate the concept that MRP2 performs a protective role in the BBB .|Furthermore , our data suggest that TR ( - ) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of Pgp in the BBB on access of drugs in the brain , without the need of inducing seizures or other Pgp - enhancing events for this purpose .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	162-163	18-19	D010672	phenytoin	Chemical	162	163	3	D012640	seizure|seizures|seizures	Disease	18:378:522	19:379:523	0:10:14	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	378-379	375-376	D010862	pilocarpine	Chemical	375	376	10	D012640	seizure|seizures|seizures	Disease	18:378:522	19:379:523	0:10:14	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	394-395	378-379	D010634	phenobarbital	Chemical	394	395	11	D012640	seizure|seizures|seizures	Disease	18:378:522	19:379:523	0:10:14	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	400-401	378-379	C402343	tariquidar	Chemical	400	401	11	D012640	seizure|seizures|seizures	Disease	18:378:522	19:379:523	0:10:14	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	162-163	460-464	D010672	phenytoin	Chemical	162	163	3	D001927	injury to the brain	Disease	460	464	13	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	375-376	460-464	D010862	pilocarpine	Chemical	375	376	10	D001927	injury to the brain	Disease	460	464	13	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	394-395	460-464	D010634	phenobarbital	Chemical	394	395	11	D001927	injury to the brain	Disease	460	464	13	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	400-401	460-464	C402343	tariquidar	Chemical	400	401	11	D001927	injury to the brain	Disease	460	464	13

234669	Effects of aminophylline on the threshold for initiating ventricular fibrillation during respiratory failure .|Cardiac arrhythmias have frequently been reported in association with respiratory failure .|The possible additive role of pharmacologic agents in precipitating cardiac disturbances in patients with respiratory failure has only recently been emphasized .|The effects of aminophylline on the ventricular fibrillation threshold during normal acid - base conditions and during respiratory failure were studied in anesthetized open chest dogs .|The ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured by passing a gated train of 12 constant current pulses through the ventricular myocardium during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle .|During the infusion of aminophylline , the ventricular fibrillation threshold was reduced by 30 to 40 percent of the control when pH and partial pressures of oxygen ( PO2 ) and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) were kept within normal limits .|When respiratory failure was produced by hypoventilation ( pH 7 . 05 to 7 . 25 ; PC02 70 to 100 mm Hg : P02 20 to 40 mm Hg ) , infusion of aminophylline resulted in an even greater decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold to 60 percent of the control level .|These experiments suggest that although many factors may contribute to the increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in respiratory failure , pharmacologic agents , particularly aminophylline , may play a significant role .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	51-52	54-56	D000628	aminophylline|aminophylline|aminophylline|aminophylline|aminophylline	Chemical	2:51:108:180:223	3:52:109:181:224	0:3:5:6:7	D014693	ventricular fibrillation|ventricular fibrillation|ventricular fibrillation|ventricular fibrillation|ventricular fibrillation	Disease	8:54:76:111:188	10:56:78:113:190	0:3:4:5:6	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	216-218	223-224	D000628	aminophylline|aminophylline|aminophylline|aminophylline|aminophylline	Chemical	2:51:108:180:223	3:52:109:181:224	0:3:5:6:7	D012131	respiratory failure|respiratory failure|respiratory failure|respiratory failure|respiratory failure|respiratory failure	Disease	11:23:40:65:147:216	13:25:42:67:149:218	0:1:2:3:6:7	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	213-215	223-224	D000628	aminophylline|aminophylline|aminophylline|aminophylline|aminophylline	Chemical	2:51:108:180:223	3:52:109:181:224	0:3:5:6:7	D001145	Cardiac arrhythmias|ventricular arrhythmias	Disease	14:213	16:215	1:7	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	35-37	51-52	D000628	aminophylline|aminophylline|aminophylline|aminophylline|aminophylline	Chemical	2:51:108:180:223	3:52:109:181:224	0:3:5:6:7	D006331	cardiac disturbances	Disease	35	37	2	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	152-153	180-181	D000628	aminophylline|aminophylline|aminophylline|aminophylline|aminophylline	Chemical	2:51:108:180:223	3:52:109:181:224	0:3:5:6:7	D007040	hypoventilation	Disease	152	153	6	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	130-131	111-113	D010100	oxygen	Chemical	130	131	5	D014693	ventricular fibrillation|ventricular fibrillation|ventricular fibrillation|ventricular fibrillation|ventricular fibrillation	Disease	8:54:76:111:188	10:56:78:113:190	0:3:4:5:6	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	132-133	111-113	C093415	PO2	Chemical	132	133	5	D014693	ventricular fibrillation|ventricular fibrillation|ventricular fibrillation|ventricular fibrillation|ventricular fibrillation	Disease	8:54:76:111:188	10:56:78:113:190	0:3:4:5:6	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	135-137	111-113	D002245	carbon dioxide|CO2	Chemical	135:138	137:139	5:5	D014693	ventricular fibrillation|ventricular fibrillation|ventricular fibrillation|ventricular fibrillation|ventricular fibrillation	Disease	8:54:76:111:188	10:56:78:113:190	0:3:4:5:6	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	147-149	130-131	D010100	oxygen	Chemical	130	131	5	D012131	respiratory failure|respiratory failure|respiratory failure|respiratory failure|respiratory failure|respiratory failure	Disease	11:23:40:65:147:216	13:25:42:67:149:218	0:1:2:3:6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	147-149	132-133	C093415	PO2	Chemical	132	133	5	D012131	respiratory failure|respiratory failure|respiratory failure|respiratory failure|respiratory failure|respiratory failure	Disease	11:23:40:65:147:216	13:25:42:67:149:218	0:1:2:3:6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	147-149	138-139	D002245	carbon dioxide|CO2	Chemical	135:138	137:139	5:5	D012131	respiratory failure|respiratory failure|respiratory failure|respiratory failure|respiratory failure|respiratory failure	Disease	11:23:40:65:147:216	13:25:42:67:149:218	0:1:2:3:6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	213-215	130-131	D010100	oxygen	Chemical	130	131	5	D001145	Cardiac arrhythmias|ventricular arrhythmias	Disease	14:213	16:215	1:7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	213-215	132-133	C093415	PO2	Chemical	132	133	5	D001145	Cardiac arrhythmias|ventricular arrhythmias	Disease	14:213	16:215	1:7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	213-215	138-139	D002245	carbon dioxide|CO2	Chemical	135:138	137:139	5:5	D001145	Cardiac arrhythmias|ventricular arrhythmias	Disease	14:213	16:215	1:7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	130-131	35-37	D010100	oxygen	Chemical	130	131	5	D006331	cardiac disturbances	Disease	35	37	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	132-133	35-37	C093415	PO2	Chemical	132	133	5	D006331	cardiac disturbances	Disease	35	37	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	135-137	35-37	D002245	carbon dioxide|CO2	Chemical	135:138	137:139	5:5	D006331	cardiac disturbances	Disease	35	37	2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	130-131	152-153	D010100	oxygen	Chemical	130	131	5	D007040	hypoventilation	Disease	152	153	6	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	132-133	152-153	C093415	PO2	Chemical	132	133	5	D007040	hypoventilation	Disease	152	153	6	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	138-139	152-153	D002245	carbon dioxide|CO2	Chemical	135:138	137:139	5:5	D007040	hypoventilation	Disease	152	153	6
16740173	Case report : acute unintentional carbachol intoxication .|INTRODUCTION : Intoxications with carbachol , a muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist are rare .|We report an interesting case investigating a ( near ) fatal poisoning .|METHODS : The son of an 84 - year - old male discovered a newspaper report stating clinical success with plant extracts in Alzheimer 's disease .|The mode of action was said to be comparable to that of the synthetic compound ' carbamylcholin ' ; that is , carbachol .|He bought 25 g of carbachol as pure substance in a pharmacy , and the father was administered 400 to 500 mg .|Carbachol concentrations in serum and urine on day 1 and 2 of hospital admission were analysed by HPLC - mass spectrometry .|RESULTS : Minutes after oral administration , the patient developed nausea , sweating and hypotension , and finally collapsed .|Bradycardia , cholinergic symptoms and asystole occurred .|Initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation and immediate treatment with adrenaline ( epinephrine ) , atropine and furosemide was successful .|On hospital admission , blood pressure of the intubated , bradyarrhythmic patient was 100 / 65 mmHg .|Further signs were hyperhidrosis , hypersalivation , bronchorrhoea , and severe miosis ; the electrocardiographic finding was atrio - ventricular dissociation .|High doses of atropine ( up to 50 mg per 24 hours ) , adrenaline and dopamine were necessary .|The patient was extubated 1 week later .|However , increased dyspnoea and bronchospasm necessitated reintubation .|Respiratory insufficiency was further worsened by Proteus mirabilis infection and severe bronchoconstriction .|One week later , the patient was again extubated and 3 days later was transferred to a peripheral ward .|On the next day he died , probably as a result of heart failure .|Serum samples from the first and second days contained 3 . 6 and 1 . 9 mg / l carbachol , respectively .|The corresponding urine concentrations amounted to 374 and 554 mg / l .|CONCLUSION : This case started with a media report in a popular newspaper , initiated by published , peer - reviewed research on herbals , and involved human failure in a case history , medical examination and clinical treatment .|For the first time , an analytical method for the determination of carbachol in plasma and urine has been developed .|The analysed carbachol concentration exceeded the supposed serum level resulting from a therapeutic dose by a factor of 130 to 260 .|Especially in old patients , intensivists should consider intoxications ( with cholinergics ) as a cause of acute cardiovascular failure

12464714	Crossover comparison of efficacy and preference for rizatriptan 10 mg versus ergotamine / caffeine in migraine .|Rizatriptan is a selective 5 - HT ( 1B / 1D ) receptor agonist with rapid oral absorption and early onset of action in the acute treatment of migraine .|This randomized double - blind crossover outpatient study assessed the preference for 1 rizatriptan 10 mg tablet to 2 ergotamine 1 mg / caffeine 100 mg tablets in 439 patients treating a single migraine attack with each therapy .|Of patients expressing a preference ( 89 . 1 % ) , more than twice as many preferred rizatriptan to ergotamine / caffeine ( 69 . 9 vs . 30 . 1 % , p < or = 0 . 001 ) .|Faster relief of headache was the most important reason for preference , cited by 67 . 3 % of patients preferring rizatriptan and 54 . 2 % of patients who preferred ergotamine / caffeine .|The co - primary endpoint of being pain free at 2 h was also in favor of rizatriptan .|Forty - nine percent of patients were pain free 2 h after rizatriptan , compared with 24 . 3 % treated with ergotamine / caffeine ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) , rizatriptan being superior within 1 h of treatment .|Headache relief at 2 h was 75 . 9 % for rizatriptan and 47 . 3 % for ergotamine / caffeine ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) , with rizatriptan being superior to ergotamine / caffeine within 30 min of dosing .|Almost 36 % of patients taking rizatriptan were pain free at 2 h and had no recurrence or need for additional medication within 24 h , compared to 20 % of patients on ergotamine / caffeine ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) .|Rizatriptan was also superior to ergotamine / caffeine in the proportions of patients with no nausea , vomiting , phonophobia or photophobia and for patients with normal function 2 h after drug intake ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) .|More patients were ( completely , very or somewhat ) satisfied 2 h after treatment with rizatriptan ( 69 . 8 % ) than at 2 h after treatment with ergotamine / caffeine ( 38 . 6 % , p < or = 0 . 001 ) .|Recurrence rates were 31 . 4 % with rizatriptan and 15 . 3 % with ergotamine / caffeine .|Both active treatments were well tolerated .|The most common adverse events ( incidence > or = 5 % in one group ) after rizatriptan and ergotamine / caffeine , respectively , were dizziness ( 6 . 7 and 5 . 3 % ) , nausea ( 4 . 2 and 8 . 5 % ) and somnolence ( 5 . 5 and 2 . 3 % )

6203452	Thrombotic microangiopathy and renal failure associated with antineoplastic chemotherapy .|Five patients with carcinoma developed thrombotic microangiopathy ( characterized by renal insufficiency , microangiopathic hemolytic anemia , and usually thrombocytopenia ) after treatment with cisplatin , bleomycin , and a vinca alkaloid .|One patient had thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura , three the hemolytic - uremic syndrome , and one an apparent forme fruste of one of these disorders .|Histologic examination of the renal tissue showed evidence of intravascular coagulation , primarily affecting the small arteries , arterioles , and glomeruli .|Because each patient was tumor - free or had only a small tumor at the onset of this syndrome , the thrombotic microangiopathy may have been induced by chemotherapy .|Diagnosis of this potentially fatal complication may be delayed or missed if renal tissue or the peripheral blood smear is not examined , because renal failure may be ascribed to cisplatin nephrotoxicity and the anemia and thrombocytopenia to drug -

7977601	Survey of complications of indocyanine green angiography in Japan .|PURPOSE : We evaluated the safety of indocyanine green for use in fundus angiography .|METHODS : We sent a questionnaire concerning complications of indocyanine green to 32 institutions in Japan , which were selected on the basis of the client list from the Topcon Company , which manufactures the indocyanine green fundus camera .|RESULTS : Ophthalmologists at 15 institutions responded , reporting a total of 3 , 774 indocyanine green angiograms performed on 2 , 820 patients between June 1984 and September 1992 .|Before angiography , intradermal or intravenous indocyanine green testing , or both was performed at 13 of 15 institutions .|For three patients , the decision was made not to proceed with angiography after positive preangiographic testing .|The dosage of indocyanine green used for angiography varied from 25 to 75 mg , depending upon the institution .|There were 13 cases of adverse reactions ( 0 . 34 % ) , ten of which were mild reactions such as nausea , exanthema , urtication , itchiness , and urgency to defecate , and did not require treatment .|Also recorded were one case of pain of the vein , which required treatment , and two cases of hypotension .|The two hypotensive patients required treatment for shock .|CONCLUSIONS : A comparison of frequency of adverse reactions to indocyanine green with the previously reported frequency of such reactions to fluorescein sodium indicated that indocyanine green is a safe as fluorescein for use in angiography .	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	137-139	176-177	D007208	indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green	Chemical	4:17:34:60:80:102:137:235:250	6:19:36:62:82:104:139:237:252	0:1:2:2:3:4:6:10:10	D009325	nausea	Disease	176	177	7	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	137-139	178-179	D007208	indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green	Chemical	4:17:34:60:80:102:137:235:250	6:19:36:62:82:104:139:237:252	0:1:2:2:3:4:6:10:10	D005076	exanthema	Disease	178	179	7	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	137-139	180-181	D007208	indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green	Chemical	4:17:34:60:80:102:137:235:250	6:19:36:62:82:104:139:237:252	0:1:2:2:3:4:6:10:10	D014581	urtication	Disease	180	181	7	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	137-139	182-183	D007208	indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green	Chemical	4:17:34:60:80:102:137:235:250	6:19:36:62:82:104:139:237:252	0:1:2:2:3:4:6:10:10	D011537	itchiness	Disease	182	183	7	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	201-202	235-237	D007208	indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green	Chemical	4:17:34:60:80:102:137:235:250	6:19:36:62:82:104:139:237:252	0:1:2:2:3:4:6:10:10	D010146	pain	Disease	201	202	8	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	218-219	235-237	D007208	indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green	Chemical	4:17:34:60:80:102:137:235:250	6:19:36:62:82:104:139:237:252	0:1:2:2:3:4:6:10:10	D007022	hypotension|hypotensive	Disease	214:218	215:219	8:9	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	223-224	235-237	D007208	indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green|indocyanine green	Chemical	4:17:34:60:80:102:137:235:250	6:19:36:62:82:104:139:237:252	0:1:2:2:3:4:6:10:10	D012769	shock	Disease	223	224	9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	246-248	176-177	D019793	fluorescein sodium|fluorescein	Chemical	246:256	248:257	10:10	D009325	nausea	Disease	176	177	7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	246-248	178-179	D019793	fluorescein sodium|fluorescein	Chemical	246:256	248:257	10:10	D005076	exanthema	Disease	178	179	7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	246-248	180-181	D019793	fluorescein sodium|fluorescein	Chemical	246:256	248:257	10:10	D014581	urtication	Disease	180	181	7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	246-248	182-183	D019793	fluorescein sodium|fluorescein	Chemical	246:256	248:257	10:10	D011537	itchiness	Disease	182	183	7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	246-248	201-202	D019793	fluorescein sodium|fluorescein	Chemical	246:256	248:257	10:10	D010146	pain	Disease	201	202	8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	246-248	218-219	D019793	fluorescein sodium|fluorescein	Chemical	246:256	248:257	10:10	D007022	hypotension|hypotensive	Disease	214:218	215:219	8:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	246-248	223-224	D019793	fluorescein sodium|fluorescein	Chemical	246:256	248:257	10:10	D012769	shock	Disease	223	224	9
19300402	Bradykinin receptors antagonists and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors in vincristine and streptozotocin induced hyperalgesia in chemotherapy and diabetic neuropathy rat model .|PURPOSE : The influence of an irreversible inhibitor of constitutive NO synthase ( L - NOArg ; 1 . 0 mg / kg ip ) , a relatively selective inhibitor of inducible NO synthase ( L - NIL ; 1 . 0 mg / kg ip ) and a relatively specific inhibitor of neuronal NO synthase ( 7 - NI ; 0 . 1 mg / kg ip ) , on antihyperalgesic action of selective antagonists of B2 and B1 receptors : D - Arg - [ Hyp3 , Thi5 , D - Tic7 , Oic8 ] bradykinin ( HOE 140 ; 70 nmol / kg ip ) or des Arg10 HOE 140 ( 70 nmol / kg ip ) respectively , in model of diabetic ( streptozotocin - induced ) and toxic ( vincristine - induced ) neuropathy was investigated .|METHODS : The changes in pain thresholds were determined using mechanical stimuli - - the modification of the classic paw withdrawal test described by Randall - Selitto .|RESULTS : The results of this paper confirm that inhibition of bradykinin receptors and inducible NO synthase but not neuronal NO synthase activity reduces diabetic hyperalgesia .|Pretreatment with L - NOArg and L - NIL but not 7 - NI , significantly increases antihyperalgesic activity both HOE 140 and des Arg10 HOE 140 .|It was also shown that both products of inducible NO synthase and neuronal NO synthase activation as well as bradykinin are involved in hyperalgesia produced by vincristine .|Moreover , L - NOArg and 7 - NI but not L - NIL intensify antihyperalgesic activity of HOE 140 or des - Arg10HOE 140 in toxic neuropathy .|CONCLUSIONS : Results of these studies suggest that B1 and B2 receptors are engaged in transmission of nociceptive stimuli in both diabetic and toxic neuropathy .|In streptozotocin -

15325671	Cardiac toxicity observed in association with high - dose cyclophosphamide - based chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer .|INTRODUCTION : Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent given frequently as a component of many conditioning regimens .|In high doses , its nonhematological dose - limiting toxicity is cardiomyopathy .|STUDY DESIGN : We combined paclitaxel , melphalan and high - dose cyclophosphamide , thiotepa , and carboplatin in a triple sequential high - dose regimen for patients with metastatic breast cancer .|Analysis was performed on 61 women with chemotherapy - responsive metastatic breast cancer receiving 96 - h infusional cyclophosphamide as part of a triple sequential high - dose regimen to assess association between presence of peritransplant congestive heart failure ( CHF ) and the following pretreatment characteristics : presence of electrocardiogram ( EKG ) abnormalities , age , hypertension , prior cardiac history , smoking , diabetes mellitus , prior use of anthracyclines , and left - sided chest irradiation .|RESULTS : Six of 61 women ( 10 % ) developed clinically reversible grade 3 CHF following infusional cyclophosphamide with a median percent decline in ejection fraction of 31 % .|Incidence of transient cyclophosphamide - related cardiac toxicity ( 10 % ) is comparable to previous recorded literature .|Older age was significantly correlated with the CHF development ; with median ages for the entire group and for patients developing CHF of 45 and 59 , respectively .|No association was found with other pretreatment characteristics .|CONCLUSIONS : As a result of these findings , oncologists should carefully monitor fluid balance in older patients .|Routine EKG monitoring during infusional cyclophosphamide did not predict CHF development

9334596	Endocrine screening in 1 , 022 men with erectile dysfunction : clinical significance and cost - effective strategy .|PURPOSE : We reviewed the results of serum testosterone and prolactin determination in 1 , 022 patients referred because of erectile dysfunction and compared the data with history , results of physical examination , other etiological investigations and effects of endocrine therapy to refine the rules of cost - effective endocrine screening and to pinpoint actual responsibility for hormonal abnormalities .|MATERIALS AND METHODS : Testosterone and prolactin were determined by radioimmunoassay .|Every patient was screened for testosterone and 451 were screened for prolactin on the basis of low sexual desire , gynecomastia or testosterone less than 4 ng . / ml .|Determination was repeated in case of abnormal first results .|Prolactin results were compared with those of a previous personal cohort of 1 , 340 patients with erectile dysfunction and systematic prolactin determination .|Main clinical criteria tested regarding efficiency in hormone determination were low sexual desire , small testes and gynecomastia .|Endocrine therapy consisted of testosterone heptylate or human chorionic gonadotropin for hypogonadism and bromocriptine for hyperprolactinemia .|RESULTS : Testosterone was less than 3 ng . / ml .|in 107 patients but normal in 40 % at repeat determination .|The prevalence of repeatedly low testosterone increased with age ( 4 % before age 50 years and 9 % 50 years or older ) .|Two pituitary tumors were discovered after testosterone determination .|Most of the other low testosterone levels seemed to result from nonorganic hypothalamic dysfunction because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in erectile dysfunction ( definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [ 36 % ] after androgen therapy , normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30 % and definite vasculogenic contributions in 42 % ) .|Determining testosterone only in cases of low sexual desire or abnormal physical examination would have missed 40 % of the cases with low testosterone , including 37 % of those subsequently improved by androgen therapy .|Prolactin exceeded 20 ng . / ml .|in 5 men and was normal in 2 at repeat determination .|Only 1 prolactinoma was discovered .|These data are lower than those we found during the last 2 decades ( overall prolactin greater than 20 ng . / ml .|in 1 . 86 % of 1 , 821 patients , prolactinomas in 7 , 0 . 38 % ) .|Bromocriptine was definitely effective in cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng . / ml .|( 8 of 12 compared to only 9 of 22 cases with prolactin between 20 and 35 ng . / ml . ) .|Testosterone was low in less than 50 % of cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng . / ml .|CONCLUSIONS : Low prevalences and effects of low testosterone and high prolactin in erectile dysfunction can not justify their routine determination .|However , cost - effective screening strategies recommended so far missed 40 to 50 % of cases improved with endocrine therapy and the pituitary tumors .|We now advocate that before age 50 years testosterone be determined only in cases of low sexual desire and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men older than 50 years .|Prolactin should be determined only in cases of low sexual desire , gynecomastia and / or testosterone less than 4 ng . / ml

18308784	Ginsenoside Rg1 restores the impairment of learning induced by chronic morphine administration in rats .|Rg1 , as a ginsenoside extracted from Panax ginseng , could ameliorate spatial learning impairment .|Previous studies have demonstrated that Rg1 might be a useful agent for the prevention and treatment of the adverse effects of morphine .|The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Rg1 on learning impairment by chronic morphine administration and the mechanism responsible for this effect .|Male rats were subcutaneously injected with morphine ( 10 mg / kg ) twice a day at 12 hour intervals for 10 days , and Rg1 ( 30 mg / kg ) was intraperitoneally injected 2 hours after the second injection of morphine once a day for 10 days .|Spatial learning capacity was assessed in the Morris water maze .|The results showed that rats treated with Morphine / Rg1 decreased escape latency and increased the time spent in platform quadrant and entering frequency .|By implantation of electrodes and electrophysiological recording in vivo , the results showed that Rg1 restored the long - term potentiation ( LTP ) impaired by morphine in both freely moving and anaesthetised rats .|The electrophysiological recording in vitro showed that Rg1 restored the LTP in slices from the rats treated with morphine , but not changed LTP in the slices from normal saline - or morphine / Rg1 - treated rats ; this restoration could be inhibited by N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist MK801 .|We conclude that Rg1 may significantly improve the spatial learning capacity impaired by chonic morphine administration and restore the morphine - inhibited LTP .|This effect is NMDA receptor dependent .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	65-66	67-69	C035054	Ginsenoside Rg1|Rg1|Rg1|Rg1|Rg1|Rg1|Rg1|Rg1|Rg1|Rg1	Chemical	0:15:36:65:106:151:181:209:236:264	2:16:37:66:107:152:182:210:237:265	0:1:2:3:4:6:7:8:8:9	D007859	impairment of learning|learning impairment|learning impairment	Disease	4:28:67	7:30:69	0:1:3	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	71-72	67-69	D009020	morphine|morphine|morphine|morphine|morphine|Morphine|morphine|morphine|morphine|morphine|morphine	Chemical	10:52:71:87:123:149:193:220:234:275:280	11:53:72:88:124:150:194:221:235:276:281	0:2:3:4:4:6:7:8:8:9:9	D007859	impairment of learning|learning impairment|learning impairment	Disease	4:28:67	7:30:69	0:1:3	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	28-30	19-20	D036145	ginsenoside	Chemical	19	20	1	D007859	impairment of learning|learning impairment|learning impairment	Disease	4:28:67	7:30:69	0:1:3	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	247-254	67-69	D016202	N - methyl - D - aspartate|NMDA|NMDA	Chemical	247:255:288	254:256:289	8:8:10	D007859	impairment of learning|learning impairment|learning impairment	Disease	4:28:67	7:30:69	0:1:3	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	259-260	67-69	D016291	MK801	Chemical	259	260	8	D007859	impairment of learning|learning impairment|learning impairment	Disease	4:28:67	7:30:69	0:1:3
17931375	A study on the effect of the duration of subcutaneous heparin injection on bruising and pain .|AIM : This study was carried out to determine the effect of injection duration on bruising and pain following the administration of the subcutaneous injection of heparin .|BACKGROUND : Although different methods to prevent bruising and pain following the subcutaneous injection of heparin have been widely studied and described , the effect of injection duration on the occurrence of bruising and pain is little documented .|DESIGN : This study was designed as within - subject , quasi - experimental research .|METHOD : The sample for the study consisted of 50 patients to whom subcutaneous heparin was administered .|Heparin was injected over 10 seconds on the right abdominal site and 30 seconds on the left abdominal site .|Injections areas were assessed for the presence of bruising at 48 and 72 hours after each injection .|Dimensions of the bruising on the heparin applied areas were measured using transparent millimetric measuring paper .|The visual analog scale ( VAS ) was used to measure pain intensity and a stop - watch was used to time the pain period .|Data were analysed using chi - square test , Mann - Whitney U , Wilcoxon signed ranks tests and correlation .|RESULTS : The percentage of bruising occurrence was 64 % with the injection of 10 seconds duration and 42 % in the 30 - second injection .|It was determined that the size of the bruising was smaller in the 30 - second injection .|Pain intensity and pain period were statistically significantly lower for the 30 - second injection than for the 10 - second injection .|CONCLUSIONS : It was determined that injection duration had an effect on bruising and pain following the subcutaneous administration of heparin .|This study should be repeated on a larger sample .|RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE : When administering subcutaneous heparin injections , it is important to extend the duration of the injection .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	10-11	13-14	D006493	heparin|heparin|heparin|heparin|Heparin|heparin|heparin|heparin	Chemical	10:43:60:114:118:162:308:328	11:44:61:115:119:163:309:329	0:1:2:4:5:7:13:15	D003288	bruising|bruising|bruising|bruising|bruising|bruising|bruising|bruising|bruising	Disease	13:32:52:77:146:159:225:255:300	14:33:53:78:147:160:226:256:301	0:1:2:2:6:7:10:11:13	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	10-11	15-16	D006493	heparin|heparin|heparin|heparin|Heparin|heparin|heparin|heparin	Chemical	10:43:60:114:118:162:308:328	11:44:61:115:119:163:309:329	0:1:2:4:5:7:13:15	D010146	pain|pain|pain|pain|pain|pain|Pain|pain|pain	Disease	15:34:54:79:184:196:265:268:302	16:35:55:80:185:197:266:269:303	0:1:2:2:8:8:12:12:13

induced proximal tubular necrosis appeared to be slightly less severe in rats given GM together with gum Arabic than in those given GM and cellulose .|It could be inferred that gum Arabic treatment has induced a modest amelioration of some of the histological and biochemical indices of GM nephrotoxicity .|Further work is warranted on the effect of the treatments on renal functional aspects in models of chronic renal failure , and on the mechanism ( s ) involved .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	5-7	9-10	D006170	gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic	Chemical	5:30:70:87:98:163:239:254	7:32:72:89:100:165:241:256	0:1:2:2:2:4:4:5	D007674	nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxicity|Nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxicity	Disease	9:42:122:272	10:43:123:273	0:1:3:5	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	30-32	33-36	D006170	gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic	Chemical	5:30:70:87:98:163:239:254	7:32:72:89:100:165:241:256	0:1:2:2:2:4:4:5	D058186	acute renal failure	Disease	33	36	1	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	225-227	239-241	D006170	gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic	Chemical	5:30:70:87:98:163:239:254	7:32:72:89:100:165:241:256	0:1:2:2:2:4:4:5	D007683	tubular necrosis	Disease	225	227	4	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	254-256	291-294	D006170	gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic|gum Arabic	Chemical	5:30:70:87:98:163:239:254	7:32:72:89:100:165:241:256	0:1:2:2:2:4:4:5	D007676	chronic renal failure	Disease	291	294	6	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	8-9	9-10	D005839	gentamicin|gentamicin|GM|GM|GM|GM|GM|GM|GM|GM|GM	Chemical	8:38:40:102:166:196:217:221:236:245:271	9:39:41:103:167:197:218:222:237:246:272	0:1:1:2:4:4:4:4:4:4:5	D007674	nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxicity|Nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxicity	Disease	9:42:122:272	10:43:123:273	0:1:3:5	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	33-36	38-39	D005839	gentamicin|gentamicin|GM|GM|GM|GM|GM|GM|GM|GM|GM	Chemical	8:38:40:102:166:196:217:221:236:245:271	9:39:41:103:167:197:218:222:237:246:272	0:1:1:2:4:4:4:4:4:4:5	D058186	acute renal failure	Disease	33	36	1	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	221-222	225-227	D005839	gentamicin|gentamicin|GM|GM|GM|GM|GM|GM|GM|GM|GM	Chemical	8:38:40:102:166:196:217:221:236:245:271	9:39:41:103:167:197:218:222:237:246:272	0:1:1:2:4:4:4:4:4:4:5	D007683	tubular necrosis	Disease	225	227	4	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	271-272	291-294	D005839	gentamicin|gentamicin|GM|GM|GM|GM|GM|GM|GM|GM|GM	Chemical	8:38:40:102:166:196:217:221:236:245:271	9:39:41:103:167:197:218:222:237:246:272	0:1:1:2:4:4:4:4:4:4:5	D007676	chronic renal failure	Disease	291	294	6	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	130-131	122-123	D003404	creatinine|creatinine	Chemical	130:169	131:170	3:4	D007674	nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxicity|Nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxicity	Disease	9:42:122:272	10:43:123:273	0:1:3:5	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	132-133	122-123	D014508	urea|urea	Chemical	132:171	133:172	3:4	D007674	nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxicity|Nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxicity	Disease	9:42:122:272	10:43:123:273	0:1:3:5	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	138-139	122-123	D005978	glutathione|GSH|GSH	Chemical	138:140:204	139:141:205	3:3:4	D007674	nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxicity|Nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxicity	Disease	9:42:122:272	10:43:123:273	0:1:3:5	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	130-131	33-36	D003404	creatinine|creatinine	Chemical	130:169	131:170	3:4	D058186	acute renal failure	Disease	33	36	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	132-133	33-36	D014508	urea|urea	Chemical	132:171	133:172	3:4	D058186	acute renal failure	Disease	33	36	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	138-139	33-36	D005978	glutathione|GSH|GSH	Chemical	138:140:204	139:141:205	3:3:4	D058186	acute renal failure	Disease	33	36	1	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	169-170	225-227	D003404	creatinine|creatinine	Chemical	130:169	131:170	3:4	D007683	tubular necrosis	Disease	225	227	4	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	169-170	291-294	D003404	creatinine|creatinine	Chemical	130:169	131:170	3:4	D007676	chronic renal failure	Disease	291	294	6	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	171-172	225-227	D014508	urea|urea	Chemical	132:171	133:172	3:4	D007683	tubular necrosis	Disease	225	227	4	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	171-172	291-294	D014508	urea|urea	Chemical	132:171	133:172	3:4	D007676	chronic renal failure	Disease	291	294	6	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	204-205	225-227	D005978	glutathione|GSH|GSH	Chemical	138:140:204	139:141:205	3:3:4	D007683	tubular necrosis	Disease	225	227	4	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	204-205	291-294	D005978	glutathione|GSH|GSH	Chemical	138:140:204	139:141:205	3:3:4	D007676	chronic renal failure	Disease	291	294	6

10683478	Test conditions influence the response to a drug challenge in rodents .|These studies were conducted to examine the differential response to a drug challenge under varied experimental test conditions routinely employed to study drug - induced behavioral and neurophysiological responses in rodents .|Apomorphine , a nonselective dopamine agonist , was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects , its ability to induce hypothermia , and to produce distinct changes to dopamine turnover in the rodent brain .|From such experiments there is evidence that characterization and detection of apomorphine - induced activity in rodents critically depends upon the test conditions employed .|In rats , detection of apomorphine - induced hyperactivity was facilitated by a period of acclimatization to the test conditions .|Moreover , test conditions can impact upon other physiological responses to apomorphine such as drug - induced hypothermia .|In mice , apomorphine produced qualitatively different responses under novel conditions when compared to those behaviors elicited in the home test cage .|Drug - induced gross activity counts were increased in the novel exploratory box only , while measures of stereotypic behavior were similar in both .|By contrast , apomorphine - induced locomotion was more prominent in the novel exploratory box .|Dopamine turnover ratios ( DOPAC : DA and HVA : DA ) were found to be lower in those animals exposed to the exploratory box when compared to their home cage counterparts .|However , apomorphine - induced reductions in striatal dopamine turnover were detected in both novel and home cage environments .|The implications of these findings are discussed with particular emphasis upon conducting psychopharmacological challenge tests in rodents .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	142-143	147-148	D001058	Apomorphine|apomorphine|apomorphine|apomorphine|apomorphine|apomorphine|apomorphine	Chemical	44:90:109:136:147:195:243	45:91:110:137:148:196:244	2:3:4:5:6:8:10	D007035	hypothermia|hypothermia	Disease	64:142	65:143	2:5	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	109-110	112-113	D001058	Apomorphine|apomorphine|apomorphine|apomorphine|apomorphine|apomorphine|apomorphine	Chemical	44:90:109:136:147:195:243	45:91:110:137:148:196:244	2:3:4:5:6:8:10	D006948	hyperactivity	Disease	112	113	4	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	48-50	64-65	D018491	dopamine agonist|DA|DA	Chemical	48:214:218	50:215:219	2:9:9	D007035	hypothermia|hypothermia	Disease	64:142	65:143	2:5	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	48-50	112-113	D018491	dopamine agonist|DA|DA	Chemical	48:214:218	50:215:219	2:9:9	D006948	hyperactivity	Disease	112	113	4	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	72-73	64-65	D004298	dopamine|Dopamine|dopamine	Chemical	72:208:249	73:209:250	2:9:10	D007035	hypothermia|hypothermia	Disease	64:142	65:143	2:5	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	212-213	142-143	D015102	DOPAC	Chemical	212	213	9	D007035	hypothermia|hypothermia	Disease	64:142	65:143	2:5	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	216-217	142-143	D006719	HVA	Chemical	216	217	9	D007035	hypothermia|hypothermia	Disease	64:142	65:143	2:5	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	72-73	112-113	D004298	dopamine|Dopamine|dopamine	Chemical	72:208:249	73:209:250	2:9:10	D006948	hyperactivity	Disease	112	113	4	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	212-213	112-113	D015102	DOPAC	Chemical	212	213	9	D006948	hyperactivity	Disease	112	113	4	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	216-217	112-113	D006719	HVA	Chemical	216	217	9	D006948	hyperactivity	Disease	112	113	4
