23872883	Biochemical effects of Solidago virgaurea extract on experimental cardiotoxicity .|Cardiovascular diseases ( CVDs ) are the major health problem of advanced as well as developing countries of the world .|The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of the Solidago virgaurea extract on isoproterenol - induced cardiotoxicity in rats .|The subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol ( 30 mg / kg ) into rats twice at an interval of 24 h , for two consecutive days , led to a significant increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase , creatine phosphokinase , alanine transaminase , aspartate transaminase , and angiotensin - converting enzyme activities , total cholesterol , triglycerides , free serum fatty acid , cardiac tissue malondialdehyde ( MDA ) , and nitric oxide levels and a significant decrease in levels of glutathione and superoxide dismutase in cardiac tissue as compared to the normal control group ( P < 0 . 05 ) .|Pretreatment with S . virgaurea extract for 5 weeks at a dose of 250 mg / kg followed by isoproterenol injection significantly prevented the observed alterations .|Captopril ( 50 mg / kg / day , given orally ) , an inhibitor of angiotensin - converting enzyme used as a standard cardioprotective drug , was used as a positive control in this study .|The data of the present study suggest that S . virgaurea extract exerts its protective effect by decreasing MDA level and increasing the antioxidant status in isoproterenol -

range , 4 - 9 years ) , past ecstasy users showed few signs of recovery .|Compared with present ecstasy users , the past users showed no change for ten measures , increased impairment for two measures , and improvement on just one measure .|CONCLUSIONS : Given this record of impaired memory and clinically significant levels of depression , impulsiveness , and sleep disturbance , the prognosis for the current generation of ecstasy users is a major cause for concern .	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	191-192	180-181	D018817	3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA|ecstasy|Ecstasy|3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA|ecstasy|ecstasy|ecstasy|MDMA|MDMA|MDMA|MDMA|ecstasy|ecstasy|ecstasy	Chemical	15:21:23:28:30:36:87:157:166:172:180:240:244:283:294:348	20:22:24:29:35:37:88:158:167:173:181:241:245:284:295:349	0:0:0:1:1:1:3:4:4:4:4:6:6:7:8:9	D003866	Depression|Depression|depression	Disease	0:191:333	1:192:334	0:5:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	223-224	191-192	D000431	alcohol|AN|alcohol|CAN|CAN	Chemical	139:143:148:152:223	140:144:149:153:224	4:4:4:4:6	D003866	Depression|Depression|depression	Disease	0:191:333	1:192:334	0:5:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	223-224	191-192	D009538	nicotine|AN|nicotine|CAN|CAN	Chemical	141:143:150:152:223	142:144:151:153:224	4:4:4:4:6	D003866	Depression|Depression|depression	Disease	0:191:333	1:192:334	0:5:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	223-224	191-192	D002188	cannabis|CAN|CAN	Chemical	146:152:223	147:153:224	4:4:6	D003866	Depression|Depression|depression	Disease	0:191:333	1:192:334	0:5:9	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	15-20	2-3	D018817	3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA|ecstasy|Ecstasy|3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA|ecstasy|ecstasy|ecstasy|MDMA|MDMA|MDMA|MDMA|ecstasy|ecstasy|ecstasy	Chemical	15:21:23:28:30:36:87:157:166:172:180:240:244:283:294:348	20:22:24:29:35:37:88:158:167:173:181:241:245:284:295:349	0:0:0:1:1:1:3:4:4:4:4:6:6:7:8:9	D010554	impulsiveness|Impulsiveness|impulsiveness	Disease	2:195:335	3:196:336	0:5:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	223-224	195-196	D000431	alcohol|AN|alcohol|CAN|CAN	Chemical	139:143:148:152:223	140:144:149:153:224	4:4:4:4:6	D010554	impulsiveness|Impulsiveness|impulsiveness	Disease	2:195:335	3:196:336	0:5:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	223-224	195-196	D009538	nicotine|AN|nicotine|CAN|CAN	Chemical	141:143:150:152:223	142:144:151:153:224	4:4:4:4:6	D010554	impulsiveness|Impulsiveness|impulsiveness	Disease	2:195:335	3:196:336	0:5:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	223-224	195-196	D002188	cannabis|CAN|CAN	Chemical	146:152:223	147:153:224	4:4:6	D010554	impulsiveness|Impulsiveness|impulsiveness	Disease	2:195:335	3:196:336	0:5:9	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	326-328	348-349	D018817	3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA|ecstasy|Ecstasy|3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA|ecstasy|ecstasy|ecstasy|MDMA|MDMA|MDMA|MDMA|ecstasy|ecstasy|ecstasy	Chemical	15:21:23:28:30:36:87:157:166:172:180:240:244:283:294:348	20:22:24:29:35:37:88:158:167:173:181:241:245:284:295:349	0:0:0:1:1:1:3:4:4:4:4:6:6:7:8:9	D008569	impaired memory	Disease	326	328	9	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	338-340	348-349	D018817	3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA|ecstasy|Ecstasy|3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA|ecstasy|ecstasy|ecstasy|MDMA|MDMA|MDMA|MDMA|ecstasy|ecstasy|ecstasy	Chemical	15:21:23:28:30:36:87:157:166:172:180:240:244:283:294:348	20:22:24:29:35:37:88:158:167:173:181:241:245:284:295:349	0:0:0:1:1:1:3:4:4:4:4:6:6:7:8:9	D020920	sleep disturbance	Disease	338	340	9	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	223-224	326-328	D000431	alcohol|AN|alcohol|CAN|CAN	Chemical	139:143:148:152:223	140:144:149:153:224	4:4:4:4:6	D008569	impaired memory	Disease	326	328	9	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	223-224	338-340	D000431	alcohol|AN|alcohol|CAN|CAN	Chemical	139:143:148:152:223	140:144:149:153:224	4:4:4:4:6	D020920	sleep disturbance	Disease	338	340	9	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	223-224	326-328	D009538	nicotine|AN|nicotine|CAN|CAN	Chemical	141:143:150:152:223	142:144:151:153:224	4:4:4:4:6	D008569	impaired memory	Disease	326	328	9	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	223-224	338-340	D009538	nicotine|AN|nicotine|CAN|CAN	Chemical	141:143:150:152:223	142:144:151:153:224	4:4:4:4:6	D020920	sleep disturbance	Disease	338	340	9	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	223-224	326-328	D002188	cannabis|CAN|CAN	Chemical	146:152:223	147:153:224	4:4:6	D008569	impaired memory	Disease	326	328	9	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	223-224	338-340	D002188	cannabis|CAN|CAN	Chemical	146:152:223	147:153:224	4:4:6	D020920	sleep disturbance	Disease	338	340	9

24438483	Pre - treatment of bupivacaine - induced cardiovascular depression using different lipid formulations of propofol .|BACKGROUND : Pre - treatment with lipid emulsions has been shown to increase lethal doses of bupivacaine , and the lipid content of propofol may alleviate bupivacaine - induced cardiotoxicity .|The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of propofol in intralipid or medialipid emulsions on bupivacaine - induced cardiotoxicity .|METHODS : Rats were anaesthetised with ketamine and were given 0 . 5 mg / kg / min propofol in intralipid ( Group P ) , propofol in medialipid ( Group L ) , or saline ( Group C ) over 20 min .|Thereafter , 2 mg / kg / min bupivacaine 0 . 5 % was infused .|We recorded time to first dysrhythmia occurrence , respective times to 25 % and 50 % reduction of the heart rate ( HR ) and mean arterial pressure , and time to asystole and total amount of bupivacaine consumption .|Blood and tissue samples were collected following asystole .|RESULTS : The time to first dysrhythmia occurrence , time to 25 % and 50 % reductions in HR , and time to asystole were longer in Group P than the other groups .|The cumulative bupivacaine dose given at those time points was higher in Group P . Plasma bupivacaine levels were significantly lower in Group P than in Group C .|Bupivacaine levels in the brain and heart were significantly lower in Group P and Group L than in Group C .|CONCLUSION : We conclude that pre - treatment with propofol in intralipid , compared with propofol in medialipid or saline , delayed the onset of bupivacaine - induced cardiotoxic effects as well as reduced plasma bupivacaine levels .|Further studies are needed to explore tissue bupivacaine levels of propofol in medialipid and adapt these results to clinical practice .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	4-5	7-9	D002045	bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|Bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine	Chemical	4:32:42:65:122:167:215:229:242:288:298:308	5:33:43:66:123:168:216:230:243:289:299:309	0:1:1:2:4:5:8:8:9:10:10:11	D002318	cardiovascular depression	Disease	7	9	0	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	42-43	45-46	D002045	bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|Bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine	Chemical	4:32:42:65:122:167:215:229:242:288:298:308	5:33:43:66:123:168:216:230:243:289:299:309	0:1:1:2:4:5:8:8:9:10:10:11	D066126	cardiotoxicity|cardiotoxicity|cardiotoxic	Disease	45:68:291	46:69:292	1:2:10	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	122-123	135-136	D002045	bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|Bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine	Chemical	4:32:42:65:122:167:215:229:242:288:298:308	5:33:43:66:123:168:216:230:243:289:299:309	0:1:1:2:4:5:8:8:9:10:10:11	D001145	dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia	Disease	135:185	136:186	5:7	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	162-163	167-168	D002045	bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|Bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine|bupivacaine	Chemical	4:32:42:65:122:167:215:229:242:288:298:308	5:33:43:66:123:168:216:230:243:289:299:309	0:1:1:2:4:5:8:8:9:10:10:11	D006323	asystole|asystole|asystole	Disease	162:177:202	163:178:203	5:6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	14-15	7-9	D015742	propofol|propofol|propofol|propofol|propofol|propofol|propofol|propofol	Chemical	14:39:58:88:96:272:278:311	15:40:59:89:97:273:279:312	0:1:2:3:3:10:10:11	D002318	cardiovascular depression	Disease	7	9	0	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	76-77	7-9	D007649	ketamine	Chemical	76	77	3	D002318	cardiovascular depression	Disease	7	9	0	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	39-40	45-46	D015742	propofol|propofol|propofol|propofol|propofol|propofol|propofol|propofol	Chemical	14:39:58:88:96:272:278:311	15:40:59:89:97:273:279:312	0:1:2:3:3:10:10:11	D066126	cardiotoxicity|cardiotoxicity|cardiotoxic	Disease	45:68:291	46:69:292	1:2:10	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	96-97	135-136	D015742	propofol|propofol|propofol|propofol|propofol|propofol|propofol|propofol	Chemical	14:39:58:88:96:272:278:311	15:40:59:89:97:273:279:312	0:1:2:3:3:10:10:11	D001145	dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia	Disease	135:185	136:186	5:7	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	96-97	162-163	D015742	propofol|propofol|propofol|propofol|propofol|propofol|propofol|propofol	Chemical	14:39:58:88:96:272:278:311	15:40:59:89:97:273:279:312	0:1:2:3:3:10:10:11	D006323	asystole|asystole|asystole	Disease	162:177:202	163:178:203	5:6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	76-77	68-69	D007649	ketamine	Chemical	76	77	3	D066126	cardiotoxicity|cardiotoxicity|cardiotoxic	Disease	45:68:291	46:69:292	1:2:10	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	76-77	135-136	D007649	ketamine	Chemical	76	77	3	D001145	dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia	Disease	135:185	136:186	5:7	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	76-77	162-163	D007649	ketamine	Chemical	76	77	3	D006323	asystole|asystole|asystole	Disease	162:177:202	163:178:203	5:6:7

24739405	Effects of dehydroepiandrosterone in amphetamine - induced schizophrenia models in mice .|OBJECTIVE : To examine the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) on animal models of schizophrenia .|METHODS : Seventy Swiss albino female mice ( 25 - 35 g ) were divided into 4 groups : amphetamine - free ( control ) , amphetamine , 50 , and 100 mg / kg DHEA .|The DHEA was administered intraperitoneally ( ip ) for 5 days .|Amphetamine ( 3 mg / kg ip ) induced hyper locomotion , apomorphine ( 1 . 5 mg / kg subcutaneously [ sc ] ) induced climbing , and haloperidol ( 1 . 5 mg / kg sc ) induced catalepsy tests were used as animal models of schizophrenia .|The study was conducted at the Animal Experiment Laboratories , Department of Pharmacology , Medical School , Eskisehir Osmangazi University , Eskisehir , Turkey between March and May 2012 .|Statistical analysis was carried out using Kruskal - Wallis test for hyper locomotion , and one - way ANOVA for climbing and catalepsy tests .|RESULTS : In the amphetamine - induced locomotion test , there were significant increases in all movements compared with the amphetamine - free group .|Both DHEA 50 mg / kg ( p < 0 . 05 ) , and 100 mg / kg ( p < 0 . 01 ) significantly decreased all movements compared with the amphetamine - induced locomotion group .|There was a significant difference between groups in the haloperidol - induced catalepsy test ( p < 0 . 05 ) .|There was no significant difference between groups in terms of total climbing time in the apomorphine - induced climbing test ( p > 0 . 05 ) .|CONCLUSION : We observed that DHEA reduced locomotor activity and increased catalepsy at both doses , while it had no effect on climbing behavior .|We suggest that DHEA displays typical neuroleptic - like effects , and may be used in the treatment of schizophrenia .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	2-3	7-8	D003687	dehydroepiandrosterone|dehydroepiandrosterone|DHEA|DHEA|DHEA|DHEA|DHEA|DHEA	Chemical	2:19:21:64:67:209:302:325	3:20:22:65:68:210:303:326	0:1:1:2:3:8:11:12	D012559	schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia	Disease	7:27:126:341	8:28:127:342	0:1:4:12	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	67-68	87-88	D003687	dehydroepiandrosterone|dehydroepiandrosterone|DHEA|DHEA|DHEA|DHEA|DHEA|DHEA	Chemical	2:19:21:64:67:209:302:325	3:20:22:65:68:210:303:326	0:1:1:2:3:8:11:12	D006948	hyper|hyper	Disease	87:169	88:170	4:6	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	302-303	308-309	D003687	dehydroepiandrosterone|dehydroepiandrosterone|DHEA|DHEA|DHEA|DHEA|DHEA|DHEA	Chemical	2:19:21:64:67:209:302:325	3:20:22:65:68:210:303:326	0:1:1:2:3:8:11:12	D002375	catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy	Disease	118:180:259:308	119:181:260:309	4:6:9:11	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	4-5	7-8	D000661	amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine|Amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine	Chemical	4:48:55:78:187:203:241	5:49:56:79:188:204:242	0:2:2:4:7:7:8	D012559	schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia	Disease	7:27:126:341	8:28:127:342	0:1:4:12	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	78-79	87-88	D000661	amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine|Amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine	Chemical	4:48:55:78:187:203:241	5:49:56:79:188:204:242	0:2:2:4:7:7:8	D006948	hyper|hyper	Disease	87:169	88:170	4:6	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	180-181	187-188	D000661	amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine|Amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine	Chemical	4:48:55:78:187:203:241	5:49:56:79:188:204:242	0:2:2:4:7:7:8	D002375	catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy	Disease	118:180:259:308	119:181:260:309	4:6:9:11	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	126-127	90-91	D001058	apomorphine|apomorphine	Chemical	90:284	91:285	4:10	D012559	schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia	Disease	7:27:126:341	8:28:127:342	0:1:4:12	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	126-127	107-108	D006220	haloperidol|haloperidol	Chemical	107:256	108:257	4:9	D012559	schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia	Disease	7:27:126:341	8:28:127:342	0:1:4:12	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	90-91	87-88	D001058	apomorphine|apomorphine	Chemical	90:284	91:285	4:10	D006948	hyper|hyper	Disease	87:169	88:170	4:6	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	107-108	87-88	D006220	haloperidol|haloperidol	Chemical	107:256	108:257	4:9	D006948	hyper|hyper	Disease	87:169	88:170	4:6	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	284-285	308-309	D001058	apomorphine|apomorphine	Chemical	90:284	91:285	4:10	D002375	catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy	Disease	118:180:259:308	119:181:260:309	4:6:9:11	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	256-257	259-260	D006220	haloperidol|haloperidol	Chemical	107:256	108:257	4:9	D002375	catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy	Disease	118:180:259:308	119:181:260:309	4:6:9:11

activated protein kinase .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	0-1	7-8	D000157	Aconitine|Aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine	Chemical	0:19:54:72:92:132:176:227:247:327	1:20:55:73:93:133:177:228:248:328	0:1:2:3:4:6:7:9:10:13	D001145	arrhythmia|arrhythmia|arrhythmia	Disease	7:121:338	8:122:339	0:5:13	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	52-53	54-55	D000157	Aconitine|Aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine	Chemical	0:19:54:72:92:132:176:227:247:327	1:20:55:73:93:133:177:228:248:328	0:1:2:3:4:6:7:9:10:13	D066126	cardiotoxicity	Disease	52	53	2	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	72-73	73-74	D000157	Aconitine|Aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine	Chemical	0:19:54:72:92:132:176:227:247:327	1:20:55:73:93:133:177:228:248:328	0:1:2:3:4:6:7:9:10:13	D011041	poisoning|poisoning	Disease	73:93	74:94	3:4	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	132-133	134-136	D000157	Aconitine|Aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine	Chemical	0:19:54:72:92:132:176:227:247:327	1:20:55:73:93:133:177:228:248:328	0:1:2:3:4:6:7:9:10:13	D009202	myocardial injury|myocardial injury	Disease	134:179	136:181	6:7	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	132-133	139-140	D000157	Aconitine|Aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine|aconitine	Chemical	0:19:54:72:92:132:176:227:247:327	1:20:55:73:93:133:177:228:248:328	0:1:2:3:4:6:7:9:10:13	D064420	cytotoxicity	Disease	139	140	6	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	3-4	7-8	D002118	Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca	Chemical	3:66:85:103:238:249:260:330	4:67:86:104:239:250:261:331	0:3:4:5:10:10:10:13	D001145	arrhythmia|arrhythmia|arrhythmia	Disease	7:121:338	8:122:339	0:5:13	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	52-53	66-67	D002118	Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca	Chemical	3:66:85:103:238:249:260:330	4:67:86:104:239:250:261:331	0:3:4:5:10:10:10:13	D066126	cardiotoxicity	Disease	52	53	2	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	66-67	73-74	D002118	Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca	Chemical	3:66:85:103:238:249:260:330	4:67:86:104:239:250:261:331	0:3:4:5:10:10:10:13	D011041	poisoning|poisoning	Disease	73:93	74:94	3:4	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	103-104	134-136	D002118	Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca	Chemical	3:66:85:103:238:249:260:330	4:67:86:104:239:250:261:331	0:3:4:5:10:10:10:13	D009202	myocardial injury|myocardial injury	Disease	134:179	136:181	6:7	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	103-104	139-140	D002118	Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca|Ca	Chemical	3:66:85:103:238:249:260:330	4:67:86:104:239:250:261:331	0:3:4:5:10:10:10:13	D064420	cytotoxicity	Disease	139	140	6	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	42-43	7-8	D012964	Na	Chemical	42	43	2	D001145	arrhythmia|arrhythmia|arrhythmia	Disease	7:121:338	8:122:339	0:5:13	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	154-155	121-122	D019344	lactate	Chemical	154	155	6	D001145	arrhythmia|arrhythmia|arrhythmia	Disease	7:121:338	8:122:339	0:5:13	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	217-218	121-122	D001710	biotin	Chemical	217	218	8	D001145	arrhythmia|arrhythmia|arrhythmia	Disease	7:121:338	8:122:339	0:5:13	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	42-43	52-53	D012964	Na	Chemical	42	43	2	D066126	cardiotoxicity	Disease	52	53	2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	42-43	73-74	D012964	Na	Chemical	42	43	2	D011041	poisoning|poisoning	Disease	73:93	74:94	3:4	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	42-43	134-136	D012964	Na	Chemical	42	43	2	D009202	myocardial injury|myocardial injury	Disease	134:179	136:181	6:7	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	42-43	139-140	D012964	Na	Chemical	42	43	2	D064420	cytotoxicity	Disease	139	140	6	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	154-155	52-53	D019344	lactate	Chemical	154	155	6	D066126	cardiotoxicity	Disease	52	53	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	217-218	52-53	D001710	biotin	Chemical	217	218	8	D066126	cardiotoxicity	Disease	52	53	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	154-155	93-94	D019344	lactate	Chemical	154	155	6	D011041	poisoning|poisoning	Disease	73:93	74:94	3:4	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	217-218	93-94	D001710	biotin	Chemical	217	218	8	D011041	poisoning|poisoning	Disease	73:93	74:94	3:4	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	154-155	134-136	D019344	lactate	Chemical	154	155	6	D009202	myocardial injury|myocardial injury	Disease	134:179	136:181	6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	217-218	179-181	D001710	biotin	Chemical	217	218	8	D009202	myocardial injury|myocardial injury	Disease	134:179	136:181	6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	154-155	139-140	D019344	lactate	Chemical	154	155	6	D064420	cytotoxicity	Disease	139	140	6	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	217-218	139-140	D001710	biotin	Chemical	217	218	8	D064420	cytotoxicity	Disease	139	140	6
24842192	Chronic treatment with metformin suppresses toll - like receptor 4 signaling and attenuates left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction .|Acute treatment with metformin has a protective effect in myocardial infarction by suppression of inflammatory responses due to activation of AMP - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) .|In the present study , the effect of chronic pre - treatment with metformin on cardiac dysfunction and toll - like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) activities following myocardial infarction and their relation with AMPK were assessed .|Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of 5 groups ( n = 6 ) : normal control and groups were injected isoproterenol after chronic pre - treatment with 0 , 25 , 50 , or 100mg / kg of metformin twice daily for 14 days .|Isoproterenol ( 100mg / kg ) was injected subcutaneously on the 13th and 14th days to induce acute myocardial infarction .|Isoproterenol alone decreased left ventricular systolic pressure and myocardial contractility indexed as LVdp / dtmax and LVdp / dtmin .|The left ventricular dysfunction was significantly lower in the groups treated with 25 and 50mg / kg of metformin .|Metfromin markedly lowered isoproterenol - induced elevation in the levels of TLR4 mRNA , myeloid differentiation protein 88 ( MyD88 ) , tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - a ) , and interleukin 6 ( IL - 6 ) in the heart tissues .|Similar changes were also seen in the serum levels of TNF - a and IL - 6 .|However , the lower doses of 25 and 50mg / kg were more effective than 100mg / kg .|Phosphorylated AMPKa ( p - AMPK ) in the myocardium was significantly elevated by 25mg / kg of metformin , slightly by 50mg / kg , but not by 100mg / kg .|Chronic pre -

aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , glutamine , aspartate and glutathione ) levels as well as on acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) activity in mice hippocampus after seizures .|GFC produced an increased latency to first seizure , at doses 25mg / kg ( 20 . 12 + 2 . 20 min ) , 50mg / kg ( 20 . 95 + 2 . 21 min ) or 75 mg / kg ( 23 . 43 + 1 . 99 min ) when compared with seized mice .|In addition , GABA content of mice hippocampus treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase of 46 . 90 % when compared with seized mice .|In aspartate , glutamine and glutamate levels detected a decrease of 5 . 21 % , 13 . 55 % and 21 . 80 % , respectively in mice hippocampus treated with GFC75 plus P400 when compared with seized mice .|Hippocampus mice treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase in AChE activity ( 63 . 30 % ) when compared with seized mice .|The results indicate that GFC can exert anticonvulsant activity and reduce the frequency of installation of pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus , as demonstrated by increase in latency to first seizure and decrease in mortality rate of animals .|In conclusion , our data suggest that GFC may influence in epileptogenesis and promote anticonvulsant actions in pilocarpine model by modulating the GABA and glutamate contents and of AChE activity in seized mice hippocampus .|This compound may be useful to produce neuronal protection and it can be considered as an anticonvulsant agent .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	145-146	147-148	C573355	garcinielliptone FC|Garcinielliptone FC|GFC|GFC|GFC|GFC|GFC|GFC	Chemical	8:16:19:72:89:147:303:345	10:18:20:73:90:148:304:346	0:1:1:3:4:5:9:10	D012640	seizures|seizure|seizures|seizure|seizure	Disease	14:103:145:154:329	15:104:146:155:330	0:4:4:5:9	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	19-20	42-44	C573355	garcinielliptone FC|Garcinielliptone FC|GFC|GFC|GFC|GFC|GFC|GFC	Chemical	8:16:19:72:89:147:303:345	10:18:20:73:90:148:304:346	0:1:1:3:4:5:9:10	D012871	skin diseases	Disease	42	44	2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	60-61	72-73	C573355	garcinielliptone FC|Garcinielliptone FC|GFC|GFC|GFC|GFC|GFC|GFC	Chemical	8:16:19:72:89:147:303:345	10:18:20:73:90:148:304:346	0:1:1:3:4:5:9:10	D003967	diarrheas	Disease	60	61	2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	62-64	72-73	C573355	garcinielliptone FC|Garcinielliptone FC|GFC|GFC|GFC|GFC|GFC|GFC	Chemical	8:16:19:72:89:147:303:345	10:18:20:73:90:148:304:346	0:1:1:3:4:5:9:10	D007249	inflammatory diseases	Disease	62	64	2	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	303-304	318-320	C573355	garcinielliptone FC|Garcinielliptone FC|GFC|GFC|GFC|GFC|GFC|GFC	Chemical	8:16:19:72:89:147:303:345	10:18:20:73:90:148:304:346	0:1:1:3:4:5:9:10	D013226	status epilepticus	Disease	318	320	9	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	11-12	14-15	D010862	pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine	Chemical	11:315:355	12:316:356	0:9:10	D012640	seizures|seizure|seizures|seizure|seizure	Disease	14:103:145:154:329	15:104:146:155:330	0:4:4:5:9	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	11-12	42-44	D010862	pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine	Chemical	11:315:355	12:316:356	0:9:10	D012871	skin diseases	Disease	42	44	2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	11-12	60-61	D010862	pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine	Chemical	11:315:355	12:316:356	0:9:10	D003967	diarrheas	Disease	60	61	2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	11-12	62-64	D010862	pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine	Chemical	11:315:355	12:316:356	0:9:10	D007249	inflammatory diseases	Disease	62	64	2	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	315-316	318-320	D010862	pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine	Chemical	11:315:355	12:316:356	0:9:10	D013226	status epilepticus	Disease	318	320	9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	114-116	103-104	D000596	amino acid	Chemical	114	116	4	D012640	seizures|seizure|seizures|seizure|seizure	Disease	14:103:145:154:329	15:104:146:155:330	0:4:4:5:9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	117-121	103-104	D005680	r -

deficient mice were less sensitive to this drug than the WT mice , as shown by reduced weight loss , better preservation of kidney function , down regulation of inflammatory cytokines and less acute tubular necrosis .|Moreover , treatment with the kinin B2 receptor antagonist effectively reduced the levels of serum creatinine and blood urea after cisplatin administration .|Thus , our data suggest that the kinin B2 receptor is involved in cisplatin - induced acute kidney injury by mediating the necrotic process and the expression of inflammatory cytokines , thus resulting in declined renal function .|These results highlight the kinin B2 receptor antagonist treatment in amelioration of nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin therapy .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	119-120	122-125	D002945	cisplatin|Cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	7:14:119:134:148:211:227:267	8:15:120:135:149:212:228:268	0:1:3:3:4:6:7:8	D058186	acute renal injury|acute kidney injury|acute kidney injury|acute kidney injury	Disease	10:29:122:230	13:32:125:233	0:1:3:7	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	187-190	211-212	D002945	cisplatin|Cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	7:14:119:134:148:211:227:267	8:15:120:135:149:212:228:268	0:1:3:3:4:6:7:8	D007683	acute tubular necrosis|acute tubular necrosis	Disease	51:187	54:190	1:5	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	84-85	119-120	D002945	cisplatin|Cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	7:14:119:134:148:211:227:267	8:15:120:135:149:212:228:268	0:1:3:3:4:6:7:8	D007249	inflammation	Disease	84	85	2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	105-107	119-120	D002945	cisplatin|Cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	7:14:119:134:148:211:227:267	8:15:120:135:149:212:228:268	0:1:3:3:4:6:7:8	D003928	diabetic nephropathy	Disease	105	107	2	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	148-149	171-173	D002945	cisplatin|Cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	7:14:119:134:148:211:227:267	8:15:120:135:149:212:228:268	0:1:3:3:4:6:7:8	D015431	weight loss	Disease	171	173	5	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	227-228	236-237	D002945	cisplatin|Cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	7:14:119:134:148:211:227:267	8:15:120:135:149:212:228:268	0:1:3:3:4:6:7:8	D009336	necrotic	Disease	236	237	7	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	264-265	267-268	D002945	cisplatin|Cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin|cisplatin	Chemical	7:14:119:134:148:211:227:267	8:15:120:135:149:212:228:268	0:1:3:3:4:6:7:8	D007674	nephrotoxicity	Disease	264	265	8	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	45-46	29-32	D003404	creatinine|creatinine	Chemical	45:206	46:207	1:6	D058186	acute renal injury|acute kidney injury|acute kidney injury|acute kidney injury	Disease	10:29:122:230	13:32:125:233	0:1:3:7	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	47-48	29-32	D014508	urea|urea	Chemical	47:209	48:210	1:6	D058186	acute renal injury|acute kidney injury|acute kidney injury|acute kidney injury	Disease	10:29:122:230	13:32:125:233	0:1:3:7	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	45-46	51-54	D003404	creatinine|creatinine	Chemical	45:206	46:207	1:6	D007683	acute tubular necrosis|acute tubular necrosis	Disease	51:187	54:190	1:5	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	45-46	84-85	D003404	creatinine|creatinine	Chemical	45:206	46:207	1:6	D007249	inflammation	Disease	84	85	2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	45-46	105-107	D003404	creatinine|creatinine	Chemical	45:206	46:207	1:6	D003928	diabetic nephropathy	Disease	105	107	2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	171-173	206-207	D003404	creatinine|creatinine	Chemical	45:206	46:207	1:6	D015431	weight loss	Disease	171	173	5	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	206-207	236-237	D003404	creatinine|creatinine	Chemical	45:206	46:207	1:6	D009336	necrotic	Disease	236	237	7	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	206-207	264-265	D003404	creatinine|creatinine	Chemical	45:206	46:207	1:6	D007674	nephrotoxicity	Disease	264	265	8	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	47-48	51-54	D014508	urea|urea	Chemical	47:209	48:210	1:6	D007683	acute tubular necrosis|acute tubular necrosis	Disease	51:187	54:190	1:5	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	47-48	84-85	D014508	urea|urea	Chemical	47:209	48:210	1:6	D007249	inflammation	Disease	84	85	2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	47-48	105-107	D014508	urea|urea	Chemical	47:209	48:210	1:6	D003928	diabetic nephropathy	Disease	105	107	2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	171-173	209-210	D014508	urea|urea	Chemical	47:209	48:210	1:6	D015431	weight loss	Disease	171	173	5	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	209-210	236-237	D014508	urea|urea	Chemical	47:209	48:210	1:6	D009336	necrotic	Disease	236	237	7	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	209-210	264-265	D014508	urea|urea	Chemical	47:209	48:210	1:6	D007674	nephrotoxicity	Disease	264	265	8

25054547	Characterization of a novel BCHE " silent " allele : point mutation ( p . Val204Asp ) causes loss of activity and prolonged apnea with suxamethonium .|Butyrylcholinesterase deficiency is characterized by prolonged apnea after the use of muscle relaxants ( suxamethonium or mivacurium ) in patients who have mutations in the BCHE gene .|Here , we report a case of prolonged neuromuscular block after administration of suxamethonium leading to the discovery of a novel BCHE variant ( c . 695T > A , p . Val204Asp ) .|Inhibition studies , kinetic analysis and molecular dynamics were undertaken to understand how this mutation disrupts the catalytic triad and determines a " silent " phenotype .|Low activity of patient plasma butyrylcholinesterase with butyrylthiocholine ( BTC ) and benzoylcholine , and values of dibucaine and fluoride numbers fit with heterozygous atypical silent genotype .|Electrophoretic analysis of plasma BChE of the proband and his mother showed that patient has a reduced amount of tetrameric enzyme in plasma and that minor fast - moving BChE components : monomer , dimer , and monomer - albumin conjugate are missing .|Kinetic analysis showed that the p . Val204Asp / p . Asp70Gly - p . Ala539Thr BChE displays a pure Michaelian behavior with BTC as the substrate .|Both catalytic parameters Km = 265 uM for BTC , two times higher than that of the atypical enzyme , and a low Vmax are consistent with the absence of activity against suxamethonium .|Molecular dynamic ( MD ) simulations showed that the overall effect of the mutation p . Val204Asp is disruption of hydrogen bonding between Gln223 and Glu441 , leading Ser198 and His438 to move away from each other with subsequent disruption of the catalytic triad functionality regardless of the type of substrate .|MD also showed that the enzyme volume is increased , suggesting a pre - denaturation state .|This fits with the reduced concentration of p . Ala204Asp / p . Asp70Gly - p .

25096313	Lateral antebrachial cutaneous neuropathy after steroid injection at lateral epicondyle .|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : This report aimed to present a case of lateral antebrachial cutaneous neuropathy ( LACNP ) that occurred after a steroid injection in the lateral epicondyle to treat lateral epicondylitis in a 40 - year - old woman .|MATERIAL AND METHOD : A 40 - year - old woman presented with decreased sensation and paresthesia over her right lateral forearm ; the paresthesia had occurred after a steroid injection in the right lateral epicondyle 3 months before .|Her sensation of light touch and pain was diminished over the lateral side of the right forearm and wrist area .|RESULTS : The sensory action potential amplitude of the right lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve ( LACN ) ( 6 . 2 uV ) was lower than that of the left ( 13 . 1 uV ) .|The difference of amplitude between both sides was significant because there was more than a 50 % reduction .|She was diagnosed with right LACNP ( mainly axonal involvement ) on the basis of the clinical manifestation and the electrodiagnostic findings .|Her symptoms improved through physical therapy but persisted to some degree .|CONCLUSION : This report describes the case of a woman with LACNP that developed after a steroid injection for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis .|An electrodiagnostic study , including a nerve conduction study of the LACN , was helpful to diagnose right LACNP and to find the passage of the LACN on the lateral epicondyle .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	5-6	3-4	D013256	steroid|steroid|steroid|steroid	Chemical	5:34:82:221	6:35:83:222	0:1:2:8	D009422	neuropathy|neuropathy	Disease	3:26	4:27	0:1	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	221-222	227-229	D013256	steroid|steroid|steroid|steroid	Chemical	5:34:82:221	6:35:83:222	0:1:2:8	D013716	lateral epicondylitis|lateral epicondylitis	Disease	42:227	44:229	1:8	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	77-78	82-83	D013256	steroid|steroid|steroid|steroid	Chemical	5:34:82:221	6:35:83:222	0:1:2:8	D010292	paresthesia|paresthesia	Disease	69:77	70:78	2:2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	82-83	99-100	D013256	steroid|steroid|steroid|steroid	Chemical	5:34:82:221	6:35:83:222	0:1:2:8	D010146	pain	Disease	99	100	3
25119790	Curcumin prevents maleate - induced nephrotoxicity : relation to hemodynamic alterations , oxidative stress , mitochondrial oxygen consumption and activity of respiratory complex I .|The potential protective effect of the dietary antioxidant curcumin ( 120 mg / Kg / day for 6 days ) against the renal injury induced by maleate was evaluated .|Tubular proteinuria and oxidative stress were induced by a single injection of maleate ( 400 mg / kg ) in rats .|Maleate - induced renal injury included increase in renal vascular resistance and in the urinary excretion of total protein , glucose , sodium , neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) and N - acetyl b - D - glucosaminidase ( NAG ) , upregulation of kidney injury molecule ( KIM ) - 1 , decrease in renal blood flow and claudin - 2 expression besides of necrosis and apoptosis of tubular cells on 24 h .|Oxidative stress was determined by measuring the oxidation of lipids and proteins and diminution in renal Nrf2 levels .|Studies were also conducted in renal epithelial LLC - PK1 cells and in mitochondria isolated from kidneys of all the experimental groups .|Maleate induced cell damage and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production in LLC - PK1 cells in culture .|In addition , maleate treatment reduced oxygen consumption in ADP -

25986755	Low functional programming of renal AT2R mediates the developmental origin of glomerulosclerosis in adult offspring induced by prenatal caffeine exposure .|UNASSIGNED : Our previous study has indicated that prenatal caffeine exposure ( PCE ) could induce intrauterine growth retardation ( IUGR ) of offspring .|Recent research suggested that IUGR is a risk factor for glomerulosclerosis .|However , whether PCE could induce glomerulosclerosis and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown .|This study aimed to demonstrate the induction to glomerulosclerosis in adult offspring by PCE and its intrauterine programming mechanisms .|A rat model of IUGR was established by PCE , male fetuses and adult offspring at the age of postnatal week 24 were euthanized .|The results revealed that the adult offspring kidneys in the PCE group exhibited glomerulosclerosis as well as interstitial fibrosis , accompanied by elevated levels of serum creatinine and urine protein .|Renal angiotensin II receptor type 2 ( AT2R ) gene expression in adult offspring was reduced by PCE , whereas the renal angiotensin II receptor type 1a ( AT1aR ) / AT2R expression ratio was increased .|The fetal kidneys in the PCE group displayed an enlarged Bowman 's space and a shrunken glomerular tuft , accompanied by a reduced cortex width and an increase in the nephrogenic zone / cortical zone ratio .|Observation by electronic microscope revealed structural damage of podocytes ; the reduced expression level of podocyte marker genes , nephrin and podocin , was also detected by q - PCR .|Moreover , AT2R gene and protein expressions in fetal kidneys were inhibited by PCE , associated with the repression of the gene expression of glial - cell - line - derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF ) / tyrosine kinase receptor ( c - Ret ) signaling pathway .|These results demonstrated that PCE could induce dysplasia of fetal kidneys as well as glomerulosclerosis of adult offspring , and the low functional programming of renal AT2R might mediate the developmental origin of adult glomerulosclerosis .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	18-19	11-12	D002110	caffeine|caffeine	Chemical	18:30	19:31	0:1	D005921	glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis	Disease	11:56:64:80:130:315:335	12:57:65:81:131:316:336	0:2:3:4:6:11:11	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	143-144	130-131	D003404	creatinine	Chemical	143	144	6	D005921	glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis	Disease	11:56:64:80:130:315:335	12:57:65:81:131:316:336	0:2:3:4:6:11:11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	149-151	130-131	D000804	angiotensin II|angiotensin II	Chemical	149:170	151:172	7:7	D005921	glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis	Disease	11:56:64:80:130:315:335	12:57:65:81:131:316:336	0:2:3:4:6:11:11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	315-316	290-291	D014443	tyrosine	Chemical	290	291	10	D005921	glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis|glomerulosclerosis	Disease	11:56:64:80:130:315:335	12:57:65:81:131:316:336	0:2:3:4:6:11:11	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	30-31	37-40	D002110	caffeine|caffeine	Chemical	18:30	19:31	0:1	D005317	intrauterine growth retardation|IUGR|IUGR|IUGR	Disease	37:41:50:96	40:42:51:97	1:1:2:5	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	30-31	134-136	D002110	caffeine|caffeine	Chemical	18:30	19:31	0:1	D005355	interstitial fibrosis	Disease	134	136	6	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	30-31	308-312	D002110	caffeine|caffeine	Chemical	18:30	19:31	0:1	D007674	dysplasia of fetal kidneys	Disease	308	312	11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	143-144	96-97	D003404	creatinine	Chemical	143	144	6	D005317	intrauterine growth retardation|IUGR|IUGR|IUGR	Disease	37:41:50:96	40:42:51:97	1:1:2:5	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	149-151	96-97	D000804	angiotensin II|angiotensin II	Chemical	149:170	151:172	7:7	D005317	intrauterine growth retardation|IUGR|IUGR|IUGR	Disease	37:41:50:96	40:42:51:97	1:1:2:5	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	290-291	96-97	D014443	tyrosine	Chemical	290	291	10	D005317	intrauterine growth retardation|IUGR|IUGR|IUGR	Disease	37:41:50:96	40:42:51:97	1:1:2:5	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	143-144	134-136	D003404	creatinine	Chemical	143	144	6	D005355	interstitial fibrosis	Disease	134	136	6	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	149-151	134-136	D000804	angiotensin II|angiotensin II	Chemical	149:170	151:172	7:7	D005355	interstitial fibrosis	Disease	134	136	6	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	290-291	134-136	D014443	tyrosine	Chemical	290	291	10	D005355	interstitial fibrosis	Disease	134	136	6	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	143-144	308-312	D003404	creatinine	Chemical	143	144	6	D007674	dysplasia of fetal kidneys	Disease	308	312	11	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	170-172	308-312	D000804	angiotensin II|angiotensin II	Chemical	149:170	151:172	7:7	D007674	dysplasia of fetal kidneys	Disease	308	312	11	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	290-291	308-312	D014443	tyrosine	Chemical	290	291	10	D007674	dysplasia of fetal kidneys	Disease	308	312	11

2983630	Increased anxiogenic effects of caffeine in panic disorders .|The effects of oral administration of caffeine ( 10 mg / kg ) on behavioral ratings , somatic symptoms , blood pressure and plasma levels of 3 - methoxy - 4 - hydroxyphenethyleneglycol ( MHPG ) and cortisol were determined in 17 healthy subjects and 21 patients meeting DSM - III criteria for agoraphobia with panic attacks or panic disorder .|Caffeine produced significantly greater increases in subject - rated anxiety , nervousness , fear , nausea , palpitations , restlessness , and tremors in the patients compared with healthy subjects .|In the patients , but not the healthy subjects , these symptoms were significantly correlated with plasma caffeine levels .|Seventy - one percent of the patients reported that the behavioral effects of caffeine were similar to those experienced during panic attacks .|Caffeine did not alter plasma MHPG levels in either the healthy subjects or patients .|Caffeine increased plasma cortisol levels equally in the patient and healthy groups .|Because caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonist , these results suggest that some panic disorder patients may have abnormalities in neuronal systems involving adenosine .|Patients with anxiety disorders may benefit by avoiding caffeine -

20431083	Antithrombotic drug use , cerebral microbleeds , and intracerebral hemorrhage : a systematic review of published and unpublished studies .|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Cerebral microbleeds ( MB ) are potential risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) , but it is unclear if they are a contraindication to using antithrombotic drugs .|Insights could be gained by pooling data on MB frequency stratified by antithrombotic use in cohorts with ICH and ischemic stroke ( IS ) / transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) .|METHODS : We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished data from cohorts with stroke or TIA to compare the presence of MB in : ( 1 ) antithrombotic users vs nonantithrombotic users with ICH ; ( 2 ) antithrombotic users vs nonusers with IS / TIA ; and ( 3 ) ICH vs ischemic events stratified by antithrombotic use .|We also analyzed published and unpublished follow - up data to determine the risk of ICH in antithrombotic users with MB .|RESULTS : In a pooled analysis of 1460 ICH and 3817 IS / TIA , MB were more frequent in ICH vs IS / TIA in all treatment groups , but the excess increased from 2 . 8 ( odds ratio ; range , 2 . 3 - 3 . 5 ) in nonantithrombotic users to 5 . 7 ( range , 3 . 4 - 9 . 7 ) in antiplatelet users and 8 . 0 ( range , 3 . 5 - 17 . 8 ) in warfarin users ( P difference = 0 . 01 ) .|There was also an excess of MB in warfarin users vs nonusers with ICH ( OR , 2 . 7 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 6 - 4 . 4 ; P < 0 . 001 ) but none in warfarin users with IS / TIA ( OR , 1 . 3 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 9 - 1 . 7 ; P = 0 . 33 ; P difference = 0 . 01 ) .|There was a smaller excess of MB in antiplatelet users vs nonusers with ICH ( OR , 1 . 7 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 3 - 2 . 3 ; P < 0 . 001 ) , but findings were similar for antiplatelet users with IS / TIA ( OR , 1 . 4 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 2 - 1 . 7 ; P < 0 . 001 ; P difference = 0 . 25 ) .|In pooled follow - up data for 768 antithrombotic users , presence of MB at baseline was associated with a substantially increased risk of subsequent ICH ( OR , 12 . 1 ; 95 % CI , 3 . 4 - 42 . 5 ; P < 0 . 001 ) .|CONCLUSIONS : The excess of MB in warfarin users with ICH compared to other groups suggests that MB increase the risk of warfarin - associated ICH .|Limited prospective data corroborate these findings , but larger prospective studies are urgently required .	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	497-498	494-495	D014859	warfarin|warfarin|warfarin|warfarin|warfarin	Chemical	259:278:312:494:509	260:279:313:495:510	5:6:6:9:9	D002543	intracerebral hemorrhage|intracerebral hemorrhage|ICH|ICH|ICH|ICH|ICH|ICH|ICH|ICH|ICH|ICH|ICH|ICH	Disease	8:34:37:71:121:139:163:178:190:283:364:460:497:512	10:36:38:72:122:140:164:179:191:284:365:461:498:513	0:1:1:2:3:3:4:5:5:6:7:8:9:9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	315-316	312-313	D014859	warfarin|warfarin|warfarin|warfarin|warfarin	Chemical	259:278:312:494:509	260:279:313:495:510	5:6:6:9:9	D002544	ischemic stroke|IS|IS|IS|IS|IS|IS	Disease	73:76:131:181:192:315:399	75:77:132:182:193:316:400	2:2:3:5:5:6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	317-318	312-313	D014859	warfarin|warfarin|warfarin|warfarin|warfarin	Chemical	259:278:312:494:509	260:279:313:495:510	5:6:6:9:9	D002546	transient ischemic attack|TIA|TIA|TIA|TIA|TIA|TIA|TIA	Disease	79:83:103:133:183:194:317:401	82:84:104:134:184:195:318:402	2:2:3:3:5:5:6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	259-260	101-102	D014859	warfarin|warfarin|warfarin|warfarin|warfarin	Chemical	259:278:312:494:509	260:279:313:495:510	5:6:6:9:9	D020521	stroke	Disease	101	102	3	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	259-260	141-142	D014859	warfarin|warfarin|warfarin|warfarin|warfarin	Chemical	259:278:312:494:509	260:279:313:495:510	5:6:6:9:9	D007511	ischemic	Disease	141	142	3

1756784	Damage of substantia nigra pars reticulata during pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus in the rat : immunohistochemical study of neurons , astrocytes and serum - protein extravasation .|The substantia nigra has a gating function controlling the spread of epileptic seizure activity .|Additionally , in models of prolonged status epilepticus the pars reticulata of substantia nigra ( SNR ) suffers from a massive lesion which may arise from a massive metabolic derangement and hyperexcitation developing in the activated SNR .|In this study , status epilepticus was induced by systemic injection of pilocarpine in rats .|The neuropathology of SNR was investigated using immunohistochemical techniques with the major emphasis on the time - course of changes in neurons and astrocytes .|Animals surviving 20 , 30 , 40 , 60 min , 2 , 3 , 6 hours , 1 , 2 , and 3 days after induction of status epilepticus were perfusion - fixed , and brains processed for immunohistochemical staining of SNR .|Nissl - staining and antibodies against the neuron - specific calcium - binding protein , parvalbumin , served to detect neuronal damage in SNR .|Antibodies against the astroglia - specific cytoskeletal protein , glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) , and against the glial calcium - binding protein , S - 100 protein , were used to assess the status of astrocytes .|Immunohistochemical staining for serum - albumin and immunoglobulins in brain tissue was taken as indicator of blood - brain barrier disturbances and vasogenic edema formation .|Immunohistochemical staining indicated loss of GFAP - staining already at 30 min after induction of seizures in an oval focus situated in the center of SNR while sparing medial and lateral aspects .|At 1 h there was additional vacuolation in S -

none had any neurological symptoms .|Busulfan levels were measured by a gas chromatographic - mass spectrometry assay in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of 9 children without central nervous system disease under 600 mg / m2 busulfan with clonazepam : busulfan cerebrospinal fluid : plasma ratio was 1 . 39 .|This was significantly different ( P less than 0 . 02 ) from the cerebrospinal fluid : plasma ratio previously defined in children receiving a 16 - mg / kg total dose of busulfan .|This study shows that busulfan neurotoxicity is dose - dependent in children and efficiently prevented by clonazepam .|A busulfan dose calculated on the basis of body surface area , resulting in higher doses in young children , was followed by increased neurotoxicity , close to neurotoxicity incidence observed in adults .|Since plasma pharmacokinetic studies showed a faster busulfan clearance in children than in adults , this new dose may approximate more closely the adult systemic exposure obtained after the usual 16 - mg / kg total dose , with potential inferences in terms of anticancer or myeloablative effects .|The busulfan dose in children and infants undergoing bone marrow transplantation should be reconsidered on the basis of pharmacokinetic studies .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	360-361	359-360	D002066	busulfan|Busulfan|busulfan|Busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|Busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan	Chemical	8:18:61:78:169:183:255:274:305:309:353:359:374:414:457	9:19:62:79:170:184:256:275:306:310:354:360:375:415:458	0:1:2:3:6:7:8:10:10:10:11:12:13:14:15	D020258	neurotoxicity|neurotoxic|neurotoxicity|neurotoxicity|neurotoxicity|neurotoxicity|neurotoxicity	Disease	3:23:32:198:360:397:401	4:24:33:199:361:398:402	0:1:1:7:12:13:13	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	371-372	360-361	D002998	clonazepam|clonazepam|clonazepam	Chemical	266:307:371	267:308:372	9:10:12	D020258	neurotoxicity|neurotoxic|neurotoxicity|neurotoxicity|neurotoxicity|neurotoxicity|neurotoxicity	Disease	3:23:32:198:360:397:401	4:24:33:199:361:398:402	0:1:1:7:12:13:13	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	72-73	78-79	D002066	busulfan|Busulfan|busulfan|Busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|Busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan	Chemical	8:18:61:78:169:183:255:274:305:309:353:359:374:414:457	9:19:62:79:170:184:256:275:306:310:354:360:375:415:458	0:1:2:3:6:7:8:10:10:10:11:12:13:14:15	D009369	tumors	Disease	72	73	2	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	74-76	78-79	D002066	busulfan|Busulfan|busulfan|Busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|Busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan	Chemical	8:18:61:78:169:183:255:274:305:309:353:359:374:414:457	9:19:62:79:170:184:256:275:306:310:354:360:375:415:458	0:1:2:3:6:7:8:10:10:10:11:12:13:14:15	D001932	brain tumors	Disease	74	76	2	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	162-163	169-170	D002066	busulfan|Busulfan|busulfan|Busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|Busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan	Chemical	8:18:61:78:169:183:255:274:305:309:353:359:374:414:457	9:19:62:79:170:184:256:275:306:310:354:360:375:415:458	0:1:2:3:6:7:8:10:10:10:11:12:13:14:15	D012640	seizures	Disease	162	163	6	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	271-273	274-275	D002066	busulfan|Busulfan|busulfan|Busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|Busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan	Chemical	8:18:61:78:169:183:255:274:305:309:353:359:374:414:457	9:19:62:79:170:184:256:275:306:310:354:360:375:415:458	0:1:2:3:6:7:8:10:10:10:11:12:13:14:15	D009461	neurological symptoms	Disease	271	273	9	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	296-300	305-306	D002066	busulfan|Busulfan|busulfan|Busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|Busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan|busulfan	Chemical	8:18:61:78:169:183:255:274:305:309:353:359:374:414:457	9:19:62:79:170:184:256:275:306:310:354:360:375:415:458	0:1:2:3:6:7:8:10:10:10:11:12:13:14:15	D002493	central nervous system disease	Disease	296	300	10	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	266-267	72-73	D002998	clonazepam|clonazepam|clonazepam	Chemical	266:307:371	267:308:372	9:10:12	D009369	tumors	Disease	72	73	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	266-267	74-76	D002998	clonazepam|clonazepam|clonazepam	Chemical	266:307:371	267:308:372	9:10:12	D001932	brain tumors	Disease	74	76	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	266-267	162-163	D002998	clonazepam|clonazepam|clonazepam	Chemical	266:307:371	267:308:372	9:10:12	D012640	seizures	Disease	162	163	6	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	266-267	271-273	D002998	clonazepam|clonazepam|clonazepam	Chemical	266:307:371	267:308:372	9:10:12	D009461	neurological symptoms	Disease	271	273	9	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	296-300	307-308	D002998	clonazepam|clonazepam|clonazepam	Chemical	266:307:371	267:308:372	9:10:12	D002493	central nervous system disease	Disease	296	300	10

2553470	Anticonvulsant actions of MK - 801 on the lithium - pilocarpine model of status epilepticus in rats .|MK - 801 , a noncompetitive N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist , was tested for anticonvulsant effects in rats using two seizure models , coadministration of lithium and pilocarpine and administration of a high dose of pilocarpine alone .|Three major results are reported .|First , pretreatment with MK - 801 produced an effective and dose - dependent anticonvulsant action with the lithium - pilocarpine model but not with rats treated with pilocarpine alone , suggesting that different biochemical mechanisms control seizures in these two models .|Second , the anticonvulsant effect of MK - 801 in the lithium - pilocarpine model only occurred after initial periods of seizure activity .|This observation is suggested to be an in vivo demonstration of the conclusion derived from in vitro experiments that MK - 801 binding requires agonist - induced opening of the channel sites of the NMDA receptor .|Third , although it is relatively easy to block seizures induced by lithium and pilocarpine by administration of anticonvulsants prior to pilocarpine , it is more difficult to terminate ongoing status epilepticus and block the lethality of the seizures .|Administration of MK - 801 30 or 60 min after pilocarpine , i . e . , during status epilepticus , gradually reduced electrical and behavioral seizure activity and greatly enhanced the survival rate .|These results suggest that activation of NMDA receptors plays an important role in status epilepticus and brain damage in the lithium - pilocarpine model .|This was further supported by results showing that nonconvulsive doses of NMDA and pilocarpine were synergistic , resulting in status epilepticus and subsequent mortality .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	13-15	18-21	D016291	MK -

disease has stimulated research into the use of calcium channel blocking agents for treatment of a variety of cardiovascular diseases .|The favorable efficacy and tolerability profiles of these agents make them attractive therapeutic modalities .|Clinical applications of calcium channel blockers parallel their tissue selectivity .|In contrast to verapamil and diltiazem , which are roughly equipotent in their actions on the heart and vascular smooth muscle , the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are a group of potent peripheral vasodilator agents that exert minimal electrophysiologic effects on cardiac nodal or conduction tissue .|As the first dihydropyridine available for use in the United States , nifedipine controls angina and hypertension with minimal depression of cardiac function .|Additional members of this group of calcium channel blockers have been studied for a variety of indications for which they may offer advantages over current therapy .|Once or twice daily dosage possible with nitrendipine and nisoldipine offers a convenient administration schedule , which encourages patient compliance in long - term therapy of hypertension .|The coronary vasodilating properties of nisoldipine have led to the investigation of this agent for use in angina .|Selectivity for the cerebrovascular bed makes nimodipine potentially useful in the

3323599	The enhancement of aminonucleoside nephrosis by the co - administration of protamine .|An experimental model of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ( FSGS ) was developed in rats by the combined administration of puromycin - aminonucleoside ( AMNS ) and protamine sulfate ( PS ) .|Male Sprague - Dawley rats , uninephrectomized three weeks before , received daily injections of subcutaneous AMNS ( 1 mg / 100 g body wt ) and intravenous PS ( 2 separated doses of 2 . 5 mg / 100 g body wt ) for four days .|The series of injections were repeated another three times at 10 day intervals .|The animals were sacrificed on days 24 , 52 , and 80 .|They developed nephrotic syndrome and finally renal failure .|The time - course curve of creatinine clearance dropped and showed significant difference ( P less than 0 . 01 ) from that of each control group , such as , AMNS alone , PS alone or saline injected .|Their glomeruli showed changes of progressive FSGS .|The ultrastructural studies in the initial stage revealed significant lack of particles of perfused ruthenium red on the lamina rara externa and marked changes in epithelial cell cytoplasm .|Therefore , it is suggested that the administration of PS enhances the toxicity of AMNS on the glomerulus and readily produces progressive FSGS in rats resulting in the end -

aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) - mediated synaptic inhibition within the substantia nigra on seizures produced by pilocarpine in rats , were investigated .|In animals pretreated with microinjections of isoniazid , 150 micrograms , an inhibitor of activity of the GABA - synthesizing enzyme , L - glutamic acid decarboxylase , into the substantia nigra pars reticulata ( SNR ) , bilaterally , non - convulsant doses of pilocarpine , 100 and 200 mg / kg , resulted in severe motor limbic seizures and status epilepticus .|Electroencephalographic and behavioral monitoring revealed a profound reduction of the threshold for pilocarpine - induced convulsions .|Morphological analysis of frontal forebrain sections with light microscopy revealed seizure - related damage to the hippocampal formation , thalamus , amygdala , olfactory cortex , substantia nigra and neocortex , which is typically observed with pilocarpine in doses exceeding 350 mg / kg .|Bilateral intrastriatal injections of isoniazid did not augment seizures produced by pilocarpine , 200 mg / kg .|Application of an irreversible inhibitor of GABA transaminase , gamma - vinyl - GABA ( D , L - 4 - amino - hex - 5 - enoic acid ) , 5 micrograms , into the SNR , bilaterally , suppressed the appearance of electrographic and behavioral seizures produced by pilocarpine , 380 mg / kg .|This treatment was also sufficient to protect animals from the occurrence of brain damage .|Microinjections of gamma - vinyl - GABA , 5 micrograms , into the dorsal striatum , bilaterally , failed to prevent the development of convulsions produced by pilocarpine , 380 mg / kg .|The results demonstrate that the threshold for pilocarpine - induced seizures in rats is subjected to the regulation of the GABA - mediated synaptic inhibition within the substantia nigra .	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	5-6	2-3	D010862	pilocarpine|Pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine	Chemical	5:23:98:150:181:222:242:299:348:362	6:24:99:151:182:223:243:300:349:363	0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:9:10	D012640	seizures|convulsive|seizures|seizures|seizures|convulsions|seizure|seizures|seizures|convulsions|seizures	Disease	2:50:61:95:164:184:196:239:296:345:365	3:51:62:96:165:185:197:240:297:346:366	0:1:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:9:10	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	239-240	235-236	D007538	isoniazid|isoniazid|isoniazid	Chemical	11:111:235	12:112:236	0:3:6	D012640	seizures|convulsive|seizures|seizures|seizures|convulsions|seizure|seizures|seizures|convulsions|seizures	Disease	2:50:61:95:164:184:196:239:296:345:365	3:51:62:96:165:185:197:240:297:346:366	0:1:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:9:10	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	13-18	2-3	D020888	gamma -

3864191	Salicylate nephropathy in the Gunn rat : potential role of prostaglandins .|We examined the potential role of prostaglandins in the development of analgesic nephropathy in the Gunn strain of rat .|The homozygous Gunn rats have unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to the absence of glucuronyl transferase , leading to marked bilirubin deposition in renal medulla and papilla .|These rats are also highly susceptible to develop papillary necrosis with analgesic administration .|We used homozygous ( jj ) and phenotypically normal heterozygous ( jJ ) animals .|Four groups of rats ( n = 7 ) were studied : jj and jJ rats treated either with aspirin 300 mg / kg every other day or sham - treated .|After one week , slices of cortex , outer and inner medulla from one kidney were incubated in buffer and prostaglandin synthesis was determined by radioimmunoassay .|The other kidney was examined histologically .|A marked corticomedullary gradient of prostaglandin synthesis was observed in all groups .|PGE2 synthesis was significantly higher in outer medulla , but not cortex or inner medulla , of jj ( 38 + / - 6 ng / mg prot ) than jJ rats ( 15 + / - 3 ) ( p less than 0 . 01 ) .|Aspirin treatment reduced PGE2 synthesis in all regions , but outer medullary PGE2 remained higher in jj ( 18 + / - 3 ) than jJ rats ( 9 + / - 2 ) ( p less than 0 . 05 ) .|PGF2 alpha was also significantly higher in the outer medulla of jj rats with and without aspirin administration ( p less than 0 . 05 ) .|The changes in renal prostaglandin synthesis were accompanied by evidence of renal damage in aspirin - treated jj but not jJ rats as evidenced by : increased incidence and severity of hematuria ( p less than 0 . 01 ) ; increased serum creatinine ( p less than 0 . 05 ) ; and increase in outer medullary histopathologic lesions ( p less than 0 . 005 compared to either sham - treated jj or aspirin - treated jJ ) .|These results suggest that enhanced prostaglandin synthesis contributes to maintenance of renal function and morphological integrity , and that inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may lead to pathological renal medullary lesions and deterioration of renal function

3925479	Evidence for a cholinergic role in haloperidol - induced catalepsy .|Experiments in mice tested previous evidence that activation of cholinergic systems promotes catalepsy and that cholinergic mechanisms need to be intact for full expression of neuroleptic - induced catalepsy .|Large doses of the cholinomimetic , pilocarpine , could induce catalepsy when peripheral cholinergic receptors were blocked .|Low doses of pilocarpine caused a pronounced enhancement of the catalepsy that was induced by the dopaminergic blocker , haloperidol .|A muscarinic receptor blocker , atropine , disrupted haloperidol - induced catalepsy .|Intracranial injection of an acetylcholine - synthesis inhibitor , hemicholinium , prevented the catalepsy that is usually induced by haloperidol .|These findings suggest the hypothesis that the catalepsy that is produced by neuroleptics such as haloperidol is actually mediated by intrinsic central cholinergic systems .|Alternatively , activation of central cholinergic systems could promote catalepsy by suppression of dopaminergic systems .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	6-7	9-10	D006220	haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol|haloperidol	Chemical	6:78:88:112:129	7:79:89:113:130	0:3:4:5:6	D002375	catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy	Disease	9:23:39:51:69:91:106:121:148	10:24:40:52:70:92:107:122:149	0:1:1:2:3:4:5:6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	39-40	36-37	D014150	neuroleptic|neuroleptics	Chemical	36:126	37:127	1:6	D002375	catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy	Disease	9:23:39:51:69:91:106:121:148	10:24:40:52:70:92:107:122:149	0:1:1:2:3:4:5:6:7	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	51-52	47-48	D010862	pilocarpine|pilocarpine	Chemical	47:62	48:63	2:3	D002375	catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy	Disease	9:23:39:51:69:91:106:121:148	10:24:40:52:70:92:107:122:149	0:1:1:2:3:4:5:6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	91-92	85-86	D001285	atropine	Chemical	85	86	4	D002375	catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy	Disease	9:23:39:51:69:91:106:121:148	10:24:40:52:70:92:107:122:149	0:1:1:2:3:4:5:6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	97-98	91-92	D000109	acetylcholine	Chemical	97	98	5	D002375	catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy	Disease	9:23:39:51:69:91:106:121:148	10:24:40:52:70:92:107:122:149	0:1:1:2:3:4:5:6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	106-107	102-103	D006426	hemicholinium	Chemical	102	103	5	D002375	catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy	Disease	9:23:39:51:69:91:106:121:148	10:24:40:52:70:92:107:122:149	0:1:1:2:3:4:5:6:7
3975902	Cardiovascular dysfunction and hypersensitivity to sodium pentobarbital induced by chronic barium chloride ingestion .|Barium - supplemented Long - Evans hooded rats were characterized by a persistent hypertension that was evident after 1 month of barium ( 100 micrograms / ml mineral fortified water ) treatment .|Analysis of in vivo myocardial excitability , contractility , and metabolic characteristics at 16 months revealed other significant barium - induced disturbances within the cardiovascular system .|The most distinctive aspect of the barium effect was a demonstrated hypersensitivity of the cardiovascular system to sodium pentobarbital .|Under barbiturate anesthesia , virtually all of the myocardial contractile indices were depressed significantly in barium - exposed rats relative to the corresponding control - fed rats .|The lack of a similar response to ketamine and xylazine anesthesia revealed that the cardiovascular actions of sodium pentobarbital in barium - treated rats were linked specifically to this anesthetic , and were not representative of a generalized anesthetic response .|Other myocardial pathophysiologic and metabolic changes induced by barium were manifest , irrespective of the anesthetic employed .|The contractile element shortening velocity of the cardiac muscle fibers was significantly slower in both groups of barium - treated rats relative to the control groups , irrespective of the anesthetic regimen .|Similarly , significant disturbances in myocardial energy metabolism were detected in the barium - exposed rats which were consistent with the reduced contractile element shortening velocity .|In addition , the excitability of the cardiac conduction system was depressed preferentially in the atrioventricular nodal region of hearts from barium - exposed rats .|Overall , the altered cardiac contractility and excitability characteristics , the myocardial metabolic disturbances , and the hypersensitivity of the cardiovascular system to sodium pentobarbital suggest the existence of a heretofore undescribed cardiomyopathic disorder induced by chronic barium exposure .|These experimental findings represent the first indication that life - long barium ingestion may have significant adverse effects on the mammalian cardiovascular system .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	5-7	0-2	D010424	sodium pentobarbital|sodium

up study of 232 , 390 people who were prescribed trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole ( TMP - SMZ ) , 266 , 951 prescribed trimethoprim alone , and 196 , 397 prescribed cephalexin , to estimate the risk of serious liver , blood , skin , and renal disorders resulting in referral or hospitalization associated with these drugs .|The results were based on information recorded on office computers by selected general practitioners in the United Kingdom , together with a review of clinical records .|The risk of clinically important idiopathic liver disease was similar for persons prescribed TMP - SMZ ( 5 . 2 / 100 , 000 ) and those prescribed trimethoprim alone ( 3 . 8 / 100 , 000 ) .|The risk for those prescribed cephalexin was somewhat lower ( 2 . 0 / 100 , 000 ) .|Only five patients experienced blood disorders , one of whom was exposed to TMP - SMZ ; of seven with erythema multiforme and Stevens - Johnson syndrome , four were exposed to TMP - SMZ .|The one case of toxic epidermal necrolysis occurred in a patient who took cephalexin .|Finally , only five cases of acute parenchymal renal disease occurred , none likely to be caused by a study drug .|We conclude that the risk of the serious diseases studied is small for the three agents , and compares reasonably with the risk for many other antibiotics .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	10-13	21-23	D015662	trimethoprim -

8392553	Protective effect of clentiazem against epinephrine - induced cardiac injury in rats .|We investigated the effects of clentiazem , a 1 , 5 - benzothiazepine calcium antagonist , on epinephrine - induced cardiomyopathy in rats .|With 2 - week chronic epinephrine infusion , 16 of 30 rats died within 4 days , and severe ischemic lesions and fibrosis of the left ventricles were observed .|In epinephrine - treated rats , left atrial and left ventricular papillary muscle contractile responses to isoproterenol were reduced , but responses to calcium were normal or enhanced compared to controls .|Left ventricular alpha and beta adrenoceptor densities were also reduced compared to controls .|Treatment with clentiazem prevented epinephrine - induced death ( P < . 05 ) , and attenuated the ventricular ischemic lesions and fibrosis , in a dose - dependent manner .|Left atrial and left ventricular papillary muscle contractile responses to isoproterenol were reduced compared to controls in groups treated with clentiazem alone , but combined with epinephrine , clentiazem restored left atrial responses and enhanced left ventricular papillary responses to isoproterenol .|On the other hand clentiazem did not prevent epinephrine - induced down - regulation of alpha and beta adrenoceptors .|Interestingly , clentiazem , infused alone , resulted in decreased adrenergic receptor densities in the left ventricle .|Clentiazem also did not prevent the enhanced responses to calcium seen in the epinephrine - treated animals , although the high dose of clentiazem partially attenuated the maximal response to calcium compared to epinephrine - treated animals .|In conclusion , clentiazem attenuated epinephrine - induced cardiac injury , possibly through its effect on the adrenergic pathway .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	3-4	8-10	C056595	clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem|Clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem	Chemical	3:18:115:164:172:190:208:224:247:265	4:19:116:165:173:191:209:225:248:266	0:1:5:6:6:7:8:9:9:10	D006331	cardiac injury|cardiac injury	Disease	8:270	10:272	0:10	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	18-19	33-34	C056595	clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem|Clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem	Chemical	3:18:115:164:172:190:208:224:247:265	4:19:116:165:173:191:209:225:248:266	0:1:5:6:6:7:8:9:9:10	D009202	cardiomyopathy	Disease	33	34	1	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	115-116	132-134	C056595	clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem|Clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem	Chemical	3:18:115:164:172:190:208:224:247:265	4:19:116:165:173:191:209:225:248:266	0:1:5:6:6:7:8:9:9:10	D007511	ischemic lesions|ischemic lesions	Disease	56:132	58:134	2:5	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	115-116	135-136	C056595	clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem|Clentiazem|clentiazem|clentiazem	Chemical	3:18:115:164:172:190:208:224:247:265	4:19:116:165:173:191:209:225:248:266	0:1:5:6:6:7:8:9:9:10	D005355	fibrosis|fibrosis	Disease	59:135	60:136	2:5	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	5-6	8-10	D004837	epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine	Chemical	5:30:42:68:117:170:194:237:257:267	6:31:43:69:118:171:195:238:258:268	0:1:2:3:5:6:7:9:9:10	D006331	cardiac injury|cardiac injury	Disease	8:270	10:272	0:10	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	30-31	33-34	D004837	epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine	Chemical	5:30:42:68:117:170:194:237:257:267	6:31:43:69:118:171:195:238:258:268	0:1:2:3:5:6:7:9:9:10	D009202	cardiomyopathy	Disease	33	34	1	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	56-58	68-69	D004837	epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine	Chemical	5:30:42:68:117:170:194:237:257:267	6:31:43:69:118:171:195:238:258:268	0:1:2:3:5:6:7:9:9:10	D007511	ischemic lesions|ischemic lesions	Disease	56:132	58:134	2:5	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	59-60	68-69	D004837	epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine|epinephrine	Chemical	5:30:42:68:117:170:194:237:257:267	6:31:43:69:118:171:195:238:258:268	0:1:2:3:5:6:7:9:9:10	D005355	fibrosis|fibrosis	Disease	59:135	60:136	2:5	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	21-26	8-10	C106746	1 , 5 -

8819482	Effects of a new calcium antagonist , CD - 832 , on isoproterenol - induced myocardial ischemia in dogs with partial coronary stenosis .|Effects of CD - 832 on isoproterenol ( ISO ) - induced myocardial ischemia were studied in dogs with partial coronary stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery and findings were compared with those for nifedipine or diltiazem .|In the presence of coronary artery stenosis , 3 - min periods of intracoronary ISO infusion ( 10 ng / kg / min ) increased heart rate and maximal rate of left ventricular pressure rise , which resulted in a decrease in percentage segmental shortening and ST - segment elevation of the epicardial electrocardiogram .|After the control ISO infusion with stenosis was performed , equihypotensive doses of CD - 832 ( 3 and 10 micrograms / kg / min , n = 7 ) , nifedipine ( 1 and 3 micrograms / kg / min , n = 9 ) or diltiazem ( 10 and 30 micrograms / kg / min , n = 7 ) were infused 5 min before and during the second and third ISO infusion .|Both CD - 832 and diltiazem , but not nifedipine , significantly reduced the increase in heart rate induced by ISO infusion .|In contrast to nifedipine , CD - 832 ( 10 micrograms / kg / min ) prevented the decrease in percentage segmental shortening from 32 + / - 12 % to 115 + / - 26 % of the control value ( P < . 01 ) and ST - segment elevation from 5 . 6 + / - 1 . 0 mV to 1 . 6 + / - 1 . 3 mV ( P < . 01 ) at 3 min after ISO infusion with stenosis .|Diltiazem ( 30 micrograms / kg / min ) also prevented the decrease in percentage segmental shortening from 34 + / - 14 % to 63 + / - 18 % of the control value ( P < . 05 ) and ST - segment elevation from 4 . 7 + / - 0 . 7 mV to 2 . 1 + / - 0 . 7 mV ( P < . 01 ) at 3 min after ISO infusion with stenosis .|These data show that CD - 832 improves myocardial ischemia during ISO infusion with stenosis and suggest that the negative chronotropic property of CD - 832 plays a major role in the beneficial effects of CD - 832 .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	4-5	15-17	D002118	calcium	Chemical	4	5	0	D017202	myocardial ischemia|myocardial ischemia|myocardial ischemia	Disease	15:36:397	17:38:399	0:1:7	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	4-5	21-23	D002118	calcium	Chemical	4	5	0	D023921	coronary stenosis|coronary stenosis|coronary artery stenosis	Disease	21:44:67	23:46:70	0:1:2	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	4-5	124-125	D002118	calcium	Chemical	4	5	0	D003251	stenosis|stenosis|stenosis|stenosis	Disease	124:304:387:403	125:305:388:404	3:5:6:7	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	393-396	397-399	C082828	CD -

8996419	Population - based study of risk of venous thromboembolism associated with various oral contraceptives .|BACKGROUND : Four studies published since December , 1995 , reported that the incidence of venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) was higher in women who used oral contraceptives ( OCs ) containing the third - generation progestagens gestodene or desogestrel than in users of OCs containing second - generation progestagens .|However , confounding and bias in the design of these studies may have affected the findings .|The aim of our study was to re - examine the association between risk of VTE and OC use with a different study design and analysis to avoid some of the bias and confounding of the earlier studies .|METHODS : We used computer records of patients from 143 general practices in the UK .|The study was based on the medical records of about 540 , 000 women born between 1941 and 1981 .|All women who had a recorded diagnosis of deep - vein thrombosis , venous thrombosis not otherwise specified , or pulmonary embolus during the study period , and who had been treated with an anticoagulant were identified as potential cases of VTE .|We did a cohort analysis to estimate and compare incidence of VTE in users of the main OC preparations , and a nested case - control study to calculate the odds ratios of VTE associated with use of different types of OC , after adjustment for potential confounding factors .|In the case - control study , we matched cases to controls by exact year of birth , practice , and current use of OCs .|We used a multiple logistic regression model that included body - mass index , number of cycles , change in type of OC prescribed within 3 months of the event , previous pregnancy , and concurrent disease .|FINDINGS : 85 women met the inclusion criteria for VTE , two of whom were users of progestagen - only OCs .|Of the 83 cases of VTE associated with use of combined OCs , 43 were recorded as deep - vein thrombosis , 35 as pulmonary thrombosis , and five as venous thrombosis not otherwise specified .|The crude rate of VTE per 10 , 000 woman - years was 4 . 10 in current users of any OC , 3 . 10 in users of second - generation OCs , and 4 . 96 in users of third - generation preparations .|After adjustment for age , the rate ratio of VTE in users of third - generation relative to second - generation OCs was 1 . 68 ( 95 % CI 1 . 04 - 2 . 75 ) .|Logistic regression showed no significant difference in the risk of VTE between users of third - generation and second -

generation OCs as the reference , the odds ratios for VTE were 3 . 49 ( 1 . 21 - 10 . 12 ) for desogestrel plus 20 g ethinyloestradiol and 1 . 18 ( 0 . 66 - 2 . 17 ) for the other third - generation progestagens .|INTERPRETATION : The previously reported increase in odds ratio associated with third -

9061777	MK - 801 augments pilocarpine - induced electrographic seizure but protects against brain damage in rats .|1 . The authors examined the anticonvulsant effects of MK - 801 on the pilocarpine - induced seizure model .|Intraperitoneal injection of pilocarpine ( 400 mg / kg ) induced tonic and clonic seizure .|Scopolamine ( 10 mg / kg ) and pentobarbital ( 5 mg / kg ) prevented development of pilocarpine - induced behavioral seizure but MK - 801 ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) did not .|2 .|An electrical seizure measured with hippocampal EEG appeared in the pilocarpine - treated group .|Scopolamine and pentobarbital blocked the pilocarpine - induced electrographic seizure , MK - 801 treatment augmented the electrographic seizure induced by pilocarpine .|3 .|Brain damage was assessed by examining the hippocampus microscopically .|Pilocarpine produced neuronal death in the hippocampus , which showed pyknotic changes .|Pentobarbital , scopolamine and MK - 801 protected the brain damage by pilocarpine , though in the MK - 801 - treated group , the pyramidal cells of hippocampus appeared darker than normal .|In all treatments , granule cells of the dentate gyrus were not affected .|4 .|These results indicate that status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine is initiated by cholinergic overstimulation and propagated by glutamatergic transmission , the elevation of which may cause brain damage through an excitatory NMDA receptor - mediated mechanism .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	117-118	119-122	D016291	MK - 801|MK - 801|MK - 801|MK - 801|MK - 801|MK - 801	Chemical	0:26:77:119:160:173	3:29:80:122:163:176	0:1:3:6:10:10	D012640	seizure|seizure|tonic and clonic seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure|seizure	Disease	8:34:48:75:95:117:126	9:35:52:76:96:118:127	0:1:2:3:5:6:6	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	160-163	165-167	D016291	MK -

9125676	Efficacy and proarrhythmia with the use of d , l - sotalol for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias .|This study prospectively evaluated the clinical efficacy , the incidence of torsades de pointes , and the presumable risk factors for torsades de pointes in patients treated with d , l - sotalol for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias .|Eighty - one consecutive patients ( 54 with coronary artery disease , and 20 with dilated cardiomyopathy ) with inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation received oral d , l - sotalol to prevent induction of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia .|During oral loading with d , l - sotalol , continuous electrocardiographic ( ECG ) monitoring was performed .|Those patients in whom d , l - sotalol prevented induction of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were discharged with the drug and followed up on an outpatient basis for 21 + / - 18 months .|Induction of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia was prevented by oral d , l - sotalol in 35 ( 43 % ) patients ; the ventricular tachyarrhythmia remained inducible in 40 ( 49 % ) patients ; and two ( 2 . 5 % ) patients did not tolerate even 40 mg of d , l - sotalol once daily .|Four ( 5 % ) patients had from torsades de pointes during the initial oral treatment with d , l - sotalol .|Neither ECG [ sinus - cycle length ( SCL ) , QT or QTc interval , or U wave ] nor clinical parameters identified patients at risk for torsades de pointes .|However , the oral dose of d , l - sotalol was significantly lower in patients with torsades de pointes ( 200 + / - 46 vs . 328 + / - 53 mg / day ; p = 0 . 0017 ) .|Risk factors associated with the development of torsades de pointes were the appearance of an U wave ( p = 0 . 049 ) , female gender ( p = 0 . 015 ) , and significant dose - corrected changes of SCL , QT interval , and QTc interval ( p < 0 . 05 ) .|During follow - up , seven ( 20 % ) patients had a nonfatal ventricular tachycardia recurrence , and two ( 6 % ) patients died suddenly .|One female patient with stable cardiac disease had recurrent torsades de pointes after 2 years of successful treatment with d , l - sotalol .|Torsades de pointes occurred early during treatment even with low doses of oral d , l - sotalol .|Pronounced changes in the surface ECG ( cycle length , QT , and QTc ) in relation to the dose of oral d , l - sotalol might identify a subgroup of patients with an increased risk for torsades de pointes .|Other ECG parameters before the application of d , l - sotalol did not identify patients at increased risk for torsades de pointes .|Recurrence rates of ventricular tachyarrhythmias are high despite complete suppression of the arrhythmia during programmed stimulation .|Therefore programmed electrical stimulation in the case of d , l - sotalol seems to be of limited prognostic value .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	7-12	14-16	D013015	d , l - sotalol|d , l - sotalol|d , l - sotalol|d , l - sotalol|d , l - sotalol|d , l - sotalol|d , l - sotalol|d , l -

9128918	Chronic hyperprolactinemia and changes in dopamine neurons .|The tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic ( TIDA ) system is known to inhibit prolactin ( PRL ) secretion .|In young animals this system responds to acute elevations in serum PRL by increasing its activity .|However , this responsiveness is lost in aging rats with chronically high serum PRL levels .|The purpose of this study was to induce hyperprolactinemia in rats for extended periods of time and examine its effects on dopaminergic systems in the brain .|Hyperprolactinemia was induced by treatment with haloperidol , a dopamine receptor antagonist , and Palkovits ' microdissection technique in combination with high - performance liquid chromatography was used to measure neurotransmitter concentrations in several areas of the brain .|After 6 months of hyperprolactinemia , dopamine ( DA ) concentrations in the median eminence ( ME ) increased by 84 % over the control group .|Nine months of hyperprolactinemia produced a 50 % increase in DA concentrations in the ME over the control group .|However , DA response was lost if a 9 - month long haloperidol - induced hyperprolactinemia was followed by a 1 1 / 2 month - long extremely high increase in serum PRL levels produced by implantation of MMQ cells under the kidney capsule .|There was no change in the levels of DA , norepinephrine ( NE ) , serotonin ( 5 - HT ) , or their metabolites in the arcuate nucleus ( AN ) , medial preoptic area ( MPA ) , caudate putamen ( CP ) , substantia nigra ( SN ) , and zona incerta ( ZI ) , except for a decrease in 5 - hydroxyindoleacetic acid ( 5 - HIAA ) in the AN after 6 - months of hyperprolactinemia and an increase in DA concentrations in the AN after 9 - months of hyperprolactinemia .|These results demonstrate that hyperprolactinemia specifically affects TIDA neurons and these effects vary , depending on the duration and intensity of hyperprolactinemia .|The age - related decrease in hypothalamic dopamine function may be associated with increases in PRL secretion .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	130-131	128-129	D004298	dopamine|dopamine|dopamine|DA|DA|DA|DA|DA|dopamine	Chemical	5:94:130:132:161:173:224:302:344	6:95:131:133:162:174:225:303:345	0:5:6:6:7:8:9:9:11	D006966	hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|Hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia	Disease	1:66:85:128:154:186:297:312:318:335	2:67:86:129:155:187:298:313:319:336	0:4:5:6:7:8:9:9:10:10	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	186-187	183-184	D006220	haloperidol|haloperidol	Chemical	91:183	92:184	5:8	D006966	hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|Hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia	Disease	1:66:85:128:154:186:297:312:318:335	2:67:86:129:155:187:298:313:319:336	0:4:5:6:7:8:9:9:10:10	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	226-227	186-187	D009638	norepinephrine|NE	Chemical	226:228	227:229	9:9	D006966	hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|Hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia	Disease	1:66:85:128:154:186:297:312:318:335	2:67:86:129:155:187:298:313:319:336	0:4:5:6:7:8:9:9:10:10	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	231-232	186-187	D012701	serotonin|5 - HT	Chemical	231:233	232:236	9:9	D006966	hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|Hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia	Disease	1:66:85:128:154:186:297:312:318:335	2:67:86:129:155:187:298:313:319:336	0:4:5:6:7:8:9:9:10:10	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	297-298	285-288	D006897	5 - hydroxyindoleacetic acid|5 - HIAA	Chemical	280:285	284:288	9:9	D006966	hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|Hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemia	Disease	1:66:85:128:154:186:297:312:318:335	2:67:86:129:155:187:298:313:319:336	0:4:5:6:7:8:9:9:10:10

10327032	Risk of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy in cancer patients who received continuous infusion of 5 - fluorouracil with the complication of dehydration and infection .|From 1986 to 1998 , 29 cancer patients who had 32 episodes of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy related to continuous infusion of 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) were identified .|None of the patients had decompensated liver disease .|Onset of hyperammonemic encephalopathy varied from 0 . 5 to 5 days ( mean : 2 . 6 + / - 1 . 3 days ) after the initiation of chemotherapy .|Plasma ammonium level ranged from 248 to 2387 microg % ( mean : 626 + / - 431 microg % ) .|Among the 32 episodes , 26 ( 81 % ) had various degrees of azotemia , 18 ( 56 % ) occurred during bacterial infections and 14 ( 44 % ) without infection occurred during periods of dehydration .|Higher plasma ammonium levels and more rapid onset of hyperammonemia were seen in 18 patients with bacterial infections ( p = 0 . 003 and 0 . 0006 , respectively ) and in nine patients receiving high daily doses ( 2600 or 1800 mg / m2 ) of 5 - FU ( p = 0 . 0001 and < 0 . 0001 , respectively ) .|In 25 out of 32 episodes ( 78 % ) , plasma ammonium levels and mental status returned to normal within 2 days after adequate management .|In conclusion , hyperammonemic encephalopathy can occur in patients receiving continuous infusion of 5 - FU .|Azotemia , body fluid insufficiency and bacterial infections were frequently found in these patients .|It is therefore important to recognize this condition in patients receiving continuous infusion of 5 -

10462057	Induction of apoptosis by remoxipride metabolites in HL60 and CD34 + / CD19 - human bone marrow progenitor cells : potential relevance to remoxipride - induced aplastic anemia .|The antipsychotic agent , remoxipride [ ( S ) - ( - ) - 3 - bromo - N - [ ( 1 - ethyl - 2 - pyrrolidinyl ) methyl ] - 2 , 6 - dimethoxybenz amide ] has been associated with acquired aplastic anemia .|We have examined the ability of remoxipride , three pyrrolidine ring metabolites and five aromatic ring metabolites of the parent compound to induce apoptosis in HL60 cells and human bone marrow progenitor ( HBMP ) cells .|Cells were treated for 0 - 24 h with each compound ( 0 - 200 microM ) .|Apoptosis was assessed by fluorescence microscopy in Hoechst 33342 - and propidium iodide stained cell samples .|Results were confirmed by determination of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation using gel electrophoresis for HL60 cell samples and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay in HBMP cells .|The catechol and hydroquinone metabolites , NCQ436 and NCQ344 , induced apoptosis in HL60 and HBMP cells in a time - and concentration dependent manner , while the phenols , NCR181 , FLA873 , and FLA797 , and the derivatives formed by oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring , FLA838 , NCM001 , and NCL118 , had no effect .|No necrosis was observed in cells treated with NCQ436 but NCQ344 had a biphasic effect in both cell types , inducing apoptosis at lower concentrations and necrosis at higher concentrations .|These data show that the catechol and hydroquinone metabolites of remoxipride have direct toxic effects in HL60 and HBMP cells , leading to apoptosis , while the phenol metabolites were inactive .|Similarly , benzene -

10713017	Anorexigens and pulmonary hypertension in the United States : results from the surveillance of North American pulmonary hypertension .|BACKGROUND : The use of appetite suppressants in Europe has been associated with the development of primary pulmonary hypertension ( PPH ) .|Recently , fenfluramine appetite suppressants became widely used in the United States but were withdrawn in September 1997 because of concerns over adverse effects .|MATERIALS AND METHODS : We conducted a prospective surveillance study on patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension at 12 large referral centers in North America .|Data collected on patients seen from September 1 , 1996 , to December 31 , 1997 , included the cause of the pulmonary hypertension and its severity .|Patients with no identifiable cause of pulmonary hypertension were classed as PPH .|A history of drug exposure also was taken with special attention on the use of antidepressants , anorexigens , and amphetamines .|RESULTS : Five hundred seventy - nine patients were studied , 205 with PPH and 374 with pulmonary hypertension from other causes ( secondary pulmonary hypertension [ SPH ] ) .|The use of anorexigens was common in both groups .|However , of the medications surveyed , only the fenfluramines had a significant preferential association with PPH as compared with SPH ( adjusted odds ratio for use > 6 months , 7 . 5 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 7 to 32 . 4 ) .|The association was stronger with longer duration of use when compared to shorter duration of use and was more pronounced in recent users than in remote users .|An unexpectedly high ( 11 . 4 % ) number of patients with SPH had used anorexigens .|CONCLUSION : The magnitude of the association with PPH , the increase of association with increasing duration of use , and the specificity for fenfluramines are consistent with previous studies indicating that fenfluramines are causally related to PPH .|The high prevalence of anorexigen use in patients with SPH also raises the possibility that these drugs precipitate pulmonary hypertension in patients with underlying conditions associated with SPH .	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	44-45	39-40	D005277	fenfluramine|fenfluramines|fenfluramines|fenfluramines	Chemical	44:205:315:323	45:206:316:324	2:9:12:12	D006976	pulmonary hypertension|pulmonary hypertension|primary pulmonary hypertension|PPH|pulmonary hypertension|pulmonary hypertension|pulmonary hypertension|PPH|PPH|pulmonary hypertension|pulmonary hypertension|PPH|PPH|PPH|pulmonary hypertension	Disease	2:16:35:39:81:114:126:131:168:172:179:212:299:328:348	4:18:38:40:83:116:128:132:169:174:181:213:300:329:350	0:0:1:1:3:4:5:5:7:7:7:9:12:12:13	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	168-169	153-154	D000662	amphetamines	Chemical	153	154	6	D006976	pulmonary hypertension|pulmonary hypertension|primary pulmonary hypertension|PPH|pulmonary hypertension|pulmonary hypertension|pulmonary hypertension|PPH|PPH|pulmonary hypertension|pulmonary hypertension|PPH|PPH|PPH|pulmonary hypertension	Disease	2:16:35:39:81:114:126:131:168:172:179:212:299:328:348	4:18:38:40:83:116:128:132:169:174:181:213:300:329:350	0:0:1:1:3:4:5:5:7:7:7:9:12:12:13

10985896	Phase 2 trial of liposomal doxorubicin ( 40 mg / m ( 2 ) ) in platinum / paclitaxel - refractory ovarian and fallopian tube cancers and primary carcinoma of the peritoneum .|BACKGROUND : Several studies have demonstrated liposomal doxorubicin ( Doxil ) to be an active antineoplastic agent in platinum - resistant ovarian cancer , with dose limiting toxicity of the standard dosing regimen ( 50 mg / m ( 2 ) q 4 weeks ) being severe erythrodysesthesia ( " hand - foot syndrome " ) and stomatitis .|We wished to develop a more tolerable liposomal doxorubicin treatment regimen and document its level of activity in a well - defined patient population with platinum / paclitaxel - refractory disease .|METHODS AND MATERIALS : Patients with ovarian or fallopian tube cancers or primary peritoneal carcinoma with platinum / paclitaxel - refractory disease ( stable or progressive disease following treatment with these agents or previous objective response < 3 months in duration ) were treated with liposomal doxorubicin at a dose of 40 mg / m ( 2 ) q 4 weeks .|RESULTS : A total of 49 patients ( median age : 60 ; range 41 - 81 ) entered this phase 2 trial .|The median number of prior regimens was 2 ( range : 1 - 6 ) .|Six ( 12 % ) and 4 ( 8 % ) patients experienced grade 2 hand - foot syndrome and stomatitis , respectively ( no episodes of grade 3 ) .|One patient developed grade 3 diarrhea requiring hospitalization for hydration .|Six ( 12 % ) individuals required dose reductions .|The median number of courses of liposomal doxorubicin administered on this protocol was 2 ( range : 1 -

creatinine , > or = 132 . 6 micromol / L [ > or = 1 . 5 mg / dL ] ; age , > or = 70 years ; and patients with diabetes ) generally tolerated the high - dose strategy .|CONCLUSIONS : These findings demonstrate that ACE inhibitor therapy in most patients with CHF can be successfully titrated to and maintained at high doses , and that more aggressive use of these agents is warranted .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	5-10	14-16	D000806	angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors|angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors|ACE inhibitor|ACE inhibitor|ACE inhibitor|ACE inhibitor	Chemical	5:36:148:288:408:470	10:44:150:290:410:472	0:2:4:7:10:11	D006333	heart failure|heart failure|CHF|CHF|CHF|CHF	Disease	14:52:55:120:222:477	16:54:56:121:223:478	0:2:2:3:5:11	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	274-275	288-290	D000806	angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors|angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors|ACE inhibitor|ACE inhibitor|ACE inhibitor|ACE inhibitor	Chemical	5:36:148:288:408:470	10:44:150:290:410:472	0:2:4:7:10:11	D007022	hypotension|hypotension	Disease	274:315	275:316	6:7	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	276-278	288-290	D000806	angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors|angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors|ACE inhibitor|ACE inhibitor|ACE inhibitor|ACE inhibitor	Chemical	5:36:148:288:408:470	10:44:150:290:410:472	0:2:4:7:10:11	D007674	renal dysfunction|renal dysfunction	Disease	276:325	278:327	6:7	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	288-290	328-329	D000806	angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors|angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors|ACE inhibitor|ACE inhibitor|ACE inhibitor|ACE inhibitor	Chemical	5:36:148:288:408:470	10:44:150:290:410:472	0:2:4:7:10:11	D006947	hyperkalemia	Disease	328	329	7	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	454-455	470-472	D000806	angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors|angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors|ACE inhibitor|ACE inhibitor|ACE inhibitor|ACE inhibitor	Chemical	5:36:148:288:408:470	10:44:150:290:410:472	0:2:4:7:10:11	D003920	diabetes	Disease	454	455	10	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	120-121	118-119	D017706	Lisinopril|lisinopril|Lisinopril|lisinopril	Chemical	28:118:127:157	29:119:128:158	1:3:4:4	D006333	heart failure|heart failure|CHF|CHF|CHF|CHF	Disease	14:52:55:120:222:477	16:54:56:121:223:478	0:2:2:3:5:11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	477-478	420-421	D003404	creatinine	Chemical	420	421	10	D006333	heart failure|heart failure|CHF|CHF|CHF|CHF	Disease	14:52:55:120:222:477	16:54:56:121:223:478	0:2:2:3:5:11	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	157-158	274-275	D017706	Lisinopril|lisinopril|Lisinopril|lisinopril	Chemical	28:118:127:157	29:119:128:158	1:3:4:4	D007022	hypotension|hypotension	Disease	274:315	275:316	6:7	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	157-158	276-278	D017706	Lisinopril|lisinopril|Lisinopril|lisinopril	Chemical	28:118:127:157	29:119:128:158	1:3:4:4	D007674	renal dysfunction|renal dysfunction	Disease	276:325	278:327	6:7	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	157-158	328-329	D017706	Lisinopril|lisinopril|Lisinopril|lisinopril	Chemical	28:118:127:157	29:119:128:158	1:3:4:4	D006947	hyperkalemia	Disease	328	329	7	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	157-158	454-455	D017706	Lisinopril|lisinopril|Lisinopril|lisinopril	Chemical	28:118:127:157	29:119:128:158	1:3:4:4	D003920	diabetes	Disease	454	455	10	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	420-421	315-316	D003404	creatinine	Chemical	420	421	10	D007022	hypotension|hypotension	Disease	274:315	275:316	6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	420-421	325-327	D003404	creatinine	Chemical	420	421	10	D007674	renal dysfunction|renal dysfunction	Disease	276:325	278:327	6:7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	420-421	328-329	D003404	creatinine	Chemical	420	421	10	D006947	hyperkalemia	Disease	328	329	7	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	420-421	454-455	D003404	creatinine	Chemical	420	421	10	D003920	diabetes	Disease	454	455	10
11229942	Cocaine , ethanol , and cocaethylene cardiotoxity in an animal model of cocaine and ethanol abuse .|OBJECTIVES : Simultaneous abuse of cocaine and ethanol affects 12 million Americans annually .|In combination , these substances are substantially more toxic than either drug alone .|Their combined cardiac toxicity may be due to independent effects of each drug ; however , they may also be due to cocaethylene ( CE ) , a cocaine metabolite formed only in the presence of ethanol .|The purpose of this study was to delineate the role of CE in the combined cardiotoxicity of cocaine and ethanol in a model simulating their abuse .|METHODS : Twenty - three dogs were randomized to receive either 1 ) three intravenous ( IV ) boluses of cocaine 7 . 5 mg / kg with ethanol ( 1 g / kg ) as an IV infusion ( C + E , n = 8 ) , 2 ) three cocaine boluses only ( C , n = 6 ) , 3 ) ethanol infusion only ( E , n = 5 ) , or 4 ) placebo boluses and infusion ( n = 4 ) .|Hemodynamic measurements , electrocardiograms , and serum drug concentrations were obtained at baseline , and then at fixed time intervals after each drug was administered .|RESULTS : Two of eight dogs in the C + E group experienced cardiovascular collapse .|The most dramatic hemodynamic changes occurred after each cocaine bolus in the C + E and C only groups ; however , persistent hemodynamic changes occurred in the C + E group .|Peak CE levels were associated with a 45 % ( SD + / - 22 % , 95 % CI = 22 % to 69 % ) decrease in cardiac output ( p < 0 . 05 ) , a 56 % ( SD + / - 23 % , 95 % CI = 32 % to 80 % ) decrease in dP / dt ( max ) ( p < . 006 ) , and a 23 % ( SD + / - 15 % , 95 % CI = 7 % to 49 % ) decrease in SVO ( 2 ) ( p < 0 . 025 ) .|Ventricular arrhythmias were primarily observed in the C + E group , in which four of eight dogs experienced ventricular tachycardia .|CONCLUSIONS : Cocaine and ethanol in combination were more toxic than either substance alone .|Co -

11380496	Frequency of appearance of myeloperoxidase - antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( MPO - ANCA ) in Graves ' disease patients treated with propylthiouracil and the relationship between MPO - ANCA and clinical manifestations .|OBJECTIVE : Myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( MPO - ANCA ) - positive vasculitis has been reported in patients with Graves ' disease who were treated with propylthiouracil ( PTU ) .|The appearance of MPO - ANCA in these cases was suspected of being related to PTU because the titres of MPO - ANCA decreased when PTU was stopped .|Nevertheless , there have been no studies on the temporal relationship between the appearance of MPO - ANCA and vasculitis during PTU therapy , or on the incidence of MPO - ANCA in untreated Graves ' disease patients .|Therefore , we sought to address these parameters in patients with Graves ' disease .|PATIENTS : We investigated 102 untreated patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves ' disease for the presence of MPO - ANCA , and for the development vasculitis after starting PTU therapy .|Twenty - nine of them were later excluded because of adverse effects of PTU or because the observation period was less than 3 months .|The remaining 73 patients ( 55 women and 18 men ) , all of whom were examined for more than 3 months , were adopted as the subjects of the investigation .|The median observation period was 23 . 6 months ( range : 3 - 37 months ) .|MEASUREMENTS : MPO - ANCA was measured at intervals of 2 - 6 months .|RESULTS : Before treatment , the MPO - ANCA titres of all 102 untreated Graves ' disease patients were within the reference range ( below 10 U / ml ) .|Three ( 4 . 1 % ) of the 73 patients were positive for MPO - ANCA at 13 , 16 and 17 months , respectively , after the start of PTU therapy .|In two of them , the MPO - ANCA titres transiently increased to 12 . 8 and 15 . 0 U / ml , respectively , despite continued PTU therapy , but no vasculitic disorders developed .|In the third patient , the MPO - ANCA titre increased to 204 U / ml and she developed a higher fever , oral ulcers and polyarthralgia , but the symptoms resolved 2 weeks after stopping PTU therapy , and the MPO - ANCA titre decreased to 20 . 7 U / ml by 4 months after discontinuing PTU .|CONCLUSIONS : PTU therapy may be related to the appearance of MPO - ANCA , but MPO - ANCA does not appear to be closely related to vasculitis .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	21-22	15-18	D011441	propylthiouracil|propylthiouracil|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU	Chemical	21:60:62:80:90:115:177:193:332:363:408:430:434	22:61:63:81:91:116:178:194:333:364:409:431:435	0:1:1:2:2:3:5:6:11:12:13:13:14	D006111	Graves ' disease|Graves ' disease|Graves ' disease|Graves ' disease|Graves ' disease|Graves ' disease	Disease	15:53:128:144:159:284	18:56:131:147:162:287	0:1:3:4:5:10	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	113-114	115-116	D011441	propylthiouracil|propylthiouracil|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU	Chemical	21:60:62:80:90:115:177:193:332:363:408:430:434	22:61:63:81:91:116:178:194:333:364:409:431:435	0:1:1:2:2:3:5:6:11:12:13:13:14	D014657	vasculitis|vasculitis|vasculitis|vasculitis	Disease	46:113:174:459	47:114:175:460	1:3:5:14	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	156-157	177-178	D011441	propylthiouracil|propylthiouracil|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU	Chemical	21:60:62:80:90:115:177:193:332:363:408:430:434	22:61:63:81:91:116:178:194:333:364:409:431:435	0:1:1:2:2:3:5:6:11:12:13:13:14	D006980	hyperthyroidism	Disease	156	157	5	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	363-364	368-370	D011441	propylthiouracil|propylthiouracil|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU	Chemical	21:60:62:80:90:115:177:193:332:363:408:430:434	22:61:63:81:91:116:178:194:333:364:409:431:435	0:1:1:2:2:3:5:6:11:12:13:13:14	D014652	vasculitic disorders	Disease	368	370	12	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	393-394	408-409	D011441	propylthiouracil|propylthiouracil|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU	Chemical	21:60:62:80:90:115:177:193:332:363:408:430:434	22:61:63:81:91:116:178:194:333:364:409:431:435	0:1:1:2:2:3:5:6:11:12:13:13:14	D005334	fever	Disease	393	394	13	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	395-397	408-409	D011441	propylthiouracil|propylthiouracil|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU	Chemical	21:60:62:80:90:115:177:193:332:363:408:430:434	22:61:63:81:91:116:178:194:333:364:409:431:435	0:1:1:2:2:3:5:6:11:12:13:13:14	D019226	oral ulcers	Disease	395	397	13	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	398-399	408-409	D011441	propylthiouracil|propylthiouracil|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU|PTU	Chemical	21:60:62:80:90:115:177:193:332:363:408:430:434	22:61:63:81:91:116:178:194:333:364:409:431:435	0:1:1:2:2:3:5:6:11:12:13:13:14	D018771	polyarthralgia	Disease	398	399	13

11401944	Phase 2 early afterdepolarization as a trigger of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in acquired long - QT syndrome : direct evidence from intracellular recordings in the intact left ventricular wall .|BACKGROUND : This study examined the role of phase 2 early afterdepolarization ( EAD ) in producing a trigger to initiate torsade de pointes ( TdP ) with QT prolongation induced by dl - sotalol and azimilide .|The contribution of transmural dispersion of repolarization ( TDR ) to transmural propagation of EAD and the maintenance of TdP was also evaluated .|METHODS AND RESULTS : Transmembrane action potentials from epicardium , midmyocardium , and endocardium were recorded simultaneously , together with a transmural ECG , in arterially perfused canine and rabbit left ventricular preparations .|dl - Sotalol preferentially prolonged action potential duration ( APD ) in M cells dose - dependently ( 1 to 100 micromol / L ) , leading to QT prolongation and an increase in TDR .|Azimilide , however , significantly prolonged APD and QT interval at concentrations from 0 . 1 to 10 micromol / L but shortened them at 30 micromol / L .|Unlike dl - sotalol , azimilide ( > 3 micromol / L ) increased epicardial APD markedly , causing a diminished TDR .|Although both dl - sotalol and azimilide rarely induced EADs in canine left ventricles , they produced frequent EADs in rabbits , in which more pronounced QT prolongation was seen .|An increase in TDR by dl - sotalol facilitated transmural propagation of EADs that initiated multiple episodes of spontaneous TdP in 3 of 6 rabbit left ventricles .|Of note , although azimilide ( 3 to 10 micromol / L ) increased APD more than dl - sotalol , its EADs often failed to propagate transmurally , probably because of a diminished TDR .|CONCLUSIONS : This study provides the first direct evidence from intracellular action potential recordings that phase 2 EAD can be generated from intact ventricular wall and produce a trigger to initiate the onset of TdP under QT prolongation .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	64-65	9-11	D013015	sotalol|Sotalol|sotalol|sotalol|sotalol|sotalol	Chemical	64:128:195:219:253:293	65:129:196:220:254:294	1:4:6:7:8:9	D017180	ventricular tachycardia	Disease	9	11	0	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	66-67	9-11	C086123	azimilide|Azimilide|azimilide|azimilide|azimilide	Chemical	66:162:197:221:278	67:163:198:222:279	1:5:6:7:9	D017180	ventricular tachycardia	Disease	9	11	0	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	64-65	58-60	D013015	sotalol|Sotalol|sotalol|sotalol|sotalol|sotalol	Chemical	64:128:195:219:253:293	65:129:196:220:254:294	1:4:6:7:8:9	D008133	long - QT syndrome|QT prolongation|QT prolongation|QT prolongation|QT prolongation	Disease	13:58:154:241:346	17:60:156:243:348	0:1:4:7:10	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	66-67	58-60	C086123	azimilide|Azimilide|azimilide|azimilide|azimilide	Chemical	66:162:197:221:278	67:163:198:222:279	1:5:6:7:9	D008133	long - QT syndrome|QT prolongation|QT prolongation|QT prolongation|QT prolongation	Disease	13:58:154:241:346	17:60:156:243:348	0:1:4:7:10	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	64-65	55-56	D013015	sotalol|Sotalol|sotalol|sotalol|sotalol|sotalol	Chemical	64:128:195:219:253:293	65:129:196:220:254:294	1:4:6:7:8:9	D016171	torsade de pointes|TdP|TdP|TdP|TdP	Disease	51:55:87:265:344	54:56:88:266:345	1:1:2:8:10	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	66-67	55-56	C086123	azimilide|Azimilide|azimilide|azimilide|azimilide	Chemical	66:162:197:221:278	67:163:198:222:279	1:5:6:7:9	D016171	torsade de pointes|TdP|TdP|TdP|TdP	Disease	51:55:87:265:344	54:56:88:266:345	1:1:2:8:10

DFC , - 18 . 9 + / - 16 . 6 and after two hours : GTN , - 23 . 7 + / - 20 . 5 ; DFC , - 59 . 7 + / - 17 . 9 , p = 0 . 0001 ) .|Low back pain was also relieved by both drugs .|Headache was significantly increased by GTN but not by DCF .|Eight patients stopped using GTN because headache - - attributed to its use - - became intolerable .|These findings indicate that GTN has a reduced efficacy and tolerability by comparison with DCF in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	3-5	12-13	D005996	glyceryl trinitrate|glyceryl trinitrate|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN	Chemical	3:96:99:161:206:287:330:352:382:430:440:458	5:98:100:162:207:288:331:353:383:431:441:459	0:3:3:5:7:10:11:11:11:13:14:15	D004412	dysmenorrhea|dysmenorrhea|dysmenorrhea|dysmenorrhea|dysmenorrhea	Disease	12:25:111:131:474	13:26:112:132:475	0:1:3:4:15	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	265-266	287-288	D005996	glyceryl trinitrate|glyceryl trinitrate|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN	Chemical	3:96:99:161:206:287:330:352:382:430:440:458	5:98:100:162:207:288:331:353:383:431:441:459	0:3:3:5:7:10:11:11:11:13:14:15	D010146	pain	Disease	265	266	9	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	323-325	330-331	D005996	glyceryl trinitrate|glyceryl trinitrate|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN	Chemical	3:96:99:161:206:287:330:352:382:430:440:458	5:98:100:162:207:288:331:353:383:431:441:459	0:3:3:5:7:10:11:11:11:13:14:15	D017699	pelvic pain	Disease	323	325	11	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	415-418	430-431	D005996	glyceryl trinitrate|glyceryl trinitrate|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN	Chemical	3:96:99:161:206:287:330:352:382:430:440:458	5:98:100:162:207:288:331:353:383:431:441:459	0:3:3:5:7:10:11:11:11:13:14:15	D017116	Low back pain	Disease	415	418	12	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	440-441	442-443	D005996	glyceryl trinitrate|glyceryl trinitrate|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN|GTN	Chemical	3:96:99:161:206:287:330:352:382:430:440:458	5:98:100:162:207:288:331:353:383:431:441:459	0:3:3:5:7:10:11:11:11:13:14:15	D006261	Headache|headache	Disease	425:442	426:443	13:14	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	111-112	115-116	D004008	diclofenac|diclofenac|DCF|DCF|DCF|DCF|DCF|DCF|DCF	Chemical	6:115:117:157:196:300:316:434:468	7:116:118:158:197:301:317:435:469	0:3:3:5:7:10:11:13:15	D004412	dysmenorrhea|dysmenorrhea|dysmenorrhea|dysmenorrhea|dysmenorrhea	Disease	12:25:111:131:474	13:26:112:132:475	0:1:3:4:15	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	265-266	300-301	D004008	diclofenac|diclofenac|DCF|DCF|DCF|DCF|DCF|DCF|DCF	Chemical	6:115:117:157:196:300:316:434:468	7:116:118:158:197:301:317:435:469	0:3:3:5:7:10:11:13:15	D010146	pain	Disease	265	266	9	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	316-317	323-325	D004008	diclofenac|diclofenac|DCF|DCF|DCF|DCF|DCF|DCF|DCF	Chemical	6:115:117:157:196:300:316:434:468	7:116:118:158:197:301:317:435:469	0:3:3:5:7:10:11:13:15	D017699	pelvic pain	Disease	323	325	11	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	415-418	434-435	D004008	diclofenac|diclofenac|DCF|DCF|DCF|DCF|DCF|DCF|DCF	Chemical	6:115:117:157:196:300:316:434:468	7:116:118:158:197:301:317:435:469	0:3:3:5:7:10:11:13:15	D017116	Low back pain	Disease	415	418	12	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	434-435	442-443	D004008	diclofenac|diclofenac|DCF|DCF|DCF|DCF|DCF|DCF|DCF	Chemical	6:115:117:157:196:300:316:434:468	7:116:118:158:197:301:317:435:469	0:3:3:5:7:10:11:13:15	D006261	Headache|headache	Disease	425:442	426:443	13:14	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	40-41	25-26	D011453	prostaglandins	Chemical	40	41	1	D004412	dysmenorrhea|dysmenorrhea|dysmenorrhea|dysmenorrhea|dysmenorrhea	Disease	12:25:111:131:474	13:26:112:132:475	0:1:3:4:15	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	111-112	103-104	D009569	nitric oxide|NO|NO	Chemical	78:81:103	80:82:104	2:2:3	D004412	dysmenorrhea|dysmenorrhea|dysmenorrhea|dysmenorrhea|dysmenorrhea	Disease	12:25:111:131:474	13:26:112:132:475	0:1:3:4:15	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	40-41	265-266	D011453	prostaglandins	Chemical	40	41	1	D010146	pain	Disease	265	266	9	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	40-41	323-325	D011453	prostaglandins	Chemical	40	41	1	D017699	pelvic pain	Disease	323	325	11	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	40-41	415-418	D011453	prostaglandins	Chemical	40	41	1	D017116	Low back pain	Disease	415	418	12	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	40-41	425-426	D011453	prostaglandins	Chemical	40	41	1	D006261	Headache|headache	Disease	425:442	426:443	13:14	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	103-104	265-266	D009569	nitric oxide|NO|NO	Chemical	78:81:103	80:82:104	2:2:3	D010146	pain	Disease	265	266	9	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	103-104	323-325	D009569	nitric oxide|NO|NO	Chemical	78:81:103	80:82:104	2:2:3	D017699	pelvic pain	Disease	323	325	11	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	103-104	415-418	D009569	nitric oxide|NO|NO	Chemical	78:81:103	80:82:104	2:2:3	D017116	Low back pain	Disease	415	418	12	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	103-104	425-426	D009569	nitric oxide|NO|NO	Chemical	78:81:103	80:82:104	2:2:3	D006261	Headache|headache	Disease	425:442	426:443	13:14
11936424	Temocapril , a long - acting non - SH group angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor , modulates glomerular injury in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis .|The purpose of the present study was to determine whether chronic administration of temocapril , a long - acting non - SH group angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor , reduced proteinuria , inhibited glomerular hypertrophy and prevented glomerulosclerosis in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN ) - induced nephrotic rats .|Nephrosis was induced by injection of PAN ( 15mg / 100g body weight ) in male Sprague - Dawley ( SD ) rats .|Four groups were used , i ) the PAN group ( 14 ) , ii ) PAN / temocapril ( 13 ) , iii ) temocapril ( 14 ) and iv ) untreated controls ( 15 ) .|Temocapril ( 8 mg / kg / day ) was administered to the rats which were killed at weeks 4 , 14 or 20 .|At each time point , systolic blood pressure ( BP ) , urinary protein excretion and renal histopathological findings were evaluated , and morphometric image analysis was done .|Systolic BP in the PAN group was significantly high at 4 , 14 and 20 weeks , but was normal in the PAN / temocapril group .|Urinary protein excretion in the PAN group increased significantly , peaking at 8 days , then decreased at 4 weeks , but rose again significantly at 14 and 20 weeks .|Temocapril did not attenuate proteinuria at 8 days , but it did markedly lower it from weeks 4 to 20 .|The glomerulosclerosis index ( GSI ) was 6 . 21 % at 4 weeks and respectively 25 . 35 % and 30 . 49 % at 14 and 20 weeks in the PAN group .|There was a significant correlation between urinary protein excretion and GSI ( r = 0 . 808 , p < 0 . 0001 ) .|The ratio of glomerular tuft area to the area of Bowman 's capsules ( GT / BC ) in the PAN group was significantly increased , but it was significantly lower in the PAN / temocapril group .|It appears that temocapril was effective in retarding renal progression and protected renal function in PAN neprotic rats

12051122	Hyponatremia and syndrome of inappropriate anti - diuretic hormone reported with the use of Vincristine : an over - representation of Asians ?|PURPOSE : This retrospective study used a pharmaceutical company 's global safety database to determine the reporting rate of hyponatremia and / or syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti - diuretic hormone ( SIADH ) among vincristine - treated patients and to explore the possibility of at - risk population subgroups .|METHOD : We searched the Eli Lilly and Company 's computerized adverse event database for all reported cases of hyponatremia and / or SIADH as of 1 November 1999 that had been reported during the use of vincristine .|RESULTS : A total of 76 cases of hyponatremia and / or SIADH associated with vincristine use were identified .|The overall reporting rate was estimated to be 1 . 3 / 100 , 000 treated patients .|The average age of patients was 35 . 6 + / - 28 . 3 years , and 62 % were males .|Approximately 75 % of the patients were receiving treatment for leukemia or lymphoma .|Among the 39 reports that included information on race , the racial distribution was : 1 Black , 3 Caucasian , and 35 Asian .|CONCLUSION : Our data suggest that Asian patients may be at increased risk of hyponatremia and / or SIADH associated with vincristine use .|Although the overall reported rate of SIADH associated with vincristine is very low , physicians caring for Asian oncology patients should be aware of this potential serious but reversible adverse event .	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	129-130	122-123	D014750	Vincristine|vincristine|vincristine|vincristine|vincristine|vincristine	Chemical	14:59:112:129:235:247	15:60:113:130:236:248	0:1:2:3:8:9	D007010	Hyponatremia|hyponatremia|hyponatremia|hyponatremia|hyponatremia	Disease	0:42:94:122:228	1:43:95:123:229	0:1:2:3:8	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	59-60	56-57	D014750	Vincristine|vincristine|vincristine|vincristine|vincristine|vincristine	Chemical	14:59:112:129:235:247	15:60:113:130:236:248	0:1:2:3:8:9	D007177	syndrome of inappropriate anti - diuretic hormone|syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti - diuretic hormone|SIADH|SIADH|SIADH|SIADH|SIADH	Disease	2:46:56:98:126:232:244	9:55:57:99:127:233:245	0:1:1:2:3:8:9	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	185-186	235-236	D014750	Vincristine|vincristine|vincristine|vincristine|vincristine|vincristine	Chemical	14:59:112:129:235:247	15:60:113:130:236:248	0:1:2:3:8:9	D007938	leukemia	Disease	185	186	6	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	187-188	235-236	D014750	Vincristine|vincristine|vincristine|vincristine|vincristine|vincristine	Chemical	14:59:112:129:235:247	15:60:113:130:236:248	0:1:2:3:8:9	D008223	lymphoma	Disease	187	188	6
12059909	Delayed toxicity of cyclophosphamide on the bladder of DBA / 2 and C57BL / 6 female mouse .|The present study describes the delayed development of a severe bladder pathology in a susceptible strain of mice ( DBA / 2 ) but not in a resistant strain ( C57BL / 6 ) when both were treated with a single 300 mg / kg dose of cyclophosphamide ( CY ) .|Inbred DBA / 2 and C57BL / 6 female mice were injected with CY , and the effect of the drug on the bladder was assessed during 100 days by light microscopy using different staining procedures , and after 30 days by conventional electron microscopy .|Early CY toxicity caused a typical haemorrhagic cystitis in both strains that was completely repaired in about 7 - 10 days .|After 30 days of CY injection ulcerous and non - ulcerous forms of chronic cystitis appeared in 86 % of DBA / 2 mice but only in 4 % of C57BL / 6 mice .|Delayed cystitis was characterized by infiltration and transepithelial passage into the lumen of inflammatory cells and by frequent exfoliation of the urothelium .|Mast cells appeared in the connective and muscular layers of the bladder at a much higher number in DBA / 2 mice than in C57BL / 6 mice or untreated controls .|Electron microscopy disclosed the absence of the typical discoidal vesicles normally present in the cytoplasm of surface cells .|Instead , numerous abnormal vesicles containing one or several dark granules were observed in the cytoplasm of cells from all the epithelial layers .|Delayed cystitis still persisted in DBA / 2 mice 100 days after treatment .|These results indicate that delayed toxicity of CY in female DBA / 2 mice causes a bladder pathology that is not observed in C57BL / 6 mice .|This pathology resembles interstitial cystitis in humans and could perhaps be used as an animal model for studies on the disease .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	118-119	117-118	D003520	cyclophosphamide|cyclophosphamide|CY|CY|CY|CY|CY	Chemical	3:65:67:83:117:142:292	4:66:68:84:118:143:293	0:1:1:2:3:4:10	D064420	toxicity|toxicity|toxicity	Disease	1:118:290	2:119:291	0:3:10	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	117-118	122-123	D003520	cyclophosphamide|cyclophosphamide|CY|CY|CY|CY|CY	Chemical	3:65:67:83:117:142:292	4:66:68:84:118:143:293	0:1:1:2:3:4:10	D006470	haemorrhagic	Disease	122	123	3	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	117-118	123-124	D003520	cyclophosphamide|cyclophosphamide|CY|CY|CY|CY|CY	Chemical	3:65:67:83:117:142:292	4:66:68:84:118:143:293	0:1:1:2:3:4:10	D003556	cystitis|cystitis|cystitis|cystitis	Disease	123:152:174:272	124:153:175:273	3:4:5:9	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	292-293	316-318	D003520	cyclophosphamide|cyclophosphamide|CY|CY|CY|CY|CY	Chemical	3:65:67:83:117:142:292	4:66:68:84:118:143:293	0:1:1:2:3:4:10	D018856	interstitial cystitis	Disease	316	318	11
12119460	High - dose 5 - fluorouracil / folinic acid in combination with three - weekly mitomycin C in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer .|A phase II study .|BACKGROUND : The 24 - hour continuous infusion of 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) and folinic acid ( FA ) as part of several new multidrug chemotherapy regimens in advanced gastric cancer ( AGC ) has shown to be effective , with low toxicity .|In a previous phase II study with 3 - weekly bolus 5 - FU , FA and mitomycin C ( MMC ) we found a low toxicity rate and response rates comparable to those of regimens such as ELF , FAM or FAMTX , and a promising median overall survival .|In order to improve this MMC - dependent schedule we initiated a phase II study with high - dose 5 - FU / FA and 3 - weekly bolus MMC .|PATIENTS AND METHODS : From February , 1998 to September , 2000 we recruited 33 patients with AGC to receive weekly 24 - hour 5 - FU 2 , 600 mg / m ( 2 ) preceded by 2 - hour FA 500 mg / m ( 2 ) for 6 weeks , followed by a 2 - week rest period .|Bolus MMC 10 mg / m ( 2 ) was added in 3 - weekly intervals .|Treatment given on an outpatient basis , using portable pump systems , was repeated on day 57 .|Patients ' characteristics were : male / female ratio 20 / 13 ; median age 57 ( 27 - 75 ) years ; median WHO status 1 ( 0 - 2 ) .|18 patients had a primary AGC , and 15 showed a relapsed AGC .|Median follow - up was 11 . 8 months ( range of those surviving : 2 . 7 - 11 . 8 months ) .|RESULTS : 32 patients were evaluable for response - complete remission 9 . 1 % ( n = 3 ) , partial remission 45 . 5 % ( n = 15 ) , no change 27 . 3 % ( n = 9 ) , progressive disease 15 . 1 % ( n = 5 ) .|Median overall survival time was 10 . 2 months [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 8 . 7 - 11 . 6 ] , and median progression - free survival time was 7 . 6 months ( 95 % CI : 4 . 4 - 10 . 9 ) .|The worst toxicities ( % ) observed were ( CTC - NCI 1 / 2 / 3 ) : leukopenia 45 . 5 / 18 . 2 / 6 . 1 , thrombocytopenia 33 . 3 / 9 . 1 / 6 . 1 , vomitus 24 . 2 / 9 . 1 / 0 , diarrhea 36 . 4 / 6 . 1 / 3 . 0 , stomatitis 18 . 2 / 9 . 1 / 0 , hand - foot syndrome 12 . 1 / 0 / 0 .|Two patients developed hemolytic - uremic syndrome ( HUS ) .|CONCLUSIONS : High - dose 5 - FU / FA / MMC is an effective and well - tolerated outpatient regimen for AGC ( objective response rate 54 . 6 % ) .|It may serve as an alternative to cisplatin - containing regimens ; however , it has to be considered that possibly HUS may occur .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	177-178	184-187	D005472	5 - fluorouracil|5 - fluorouracil|5 - FU|5 - FU|5 - FU|5 - FU|5 - FU	Chemical	3:39:43:89:148:184:547	6:42:46:92:151:187:550	0:2:2:3:4:5:15	D013274	gastric cancer|gastric cancer|AGC|AGC|AGC|AGC|AGC	Disease	22:63:66:177:295:302:564	24:65:67:178:296:303:565	0:2:2:5:9:9:15	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	89-92	104-105	D005472	5 -

12165618	Persistent sterile leukocyturia is associated with impaired renal function in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 - infected children treated with indinavir .|BACKGROUND : Prolonged administration of indinavir is associated with the occurrence of a variety of renal complications in adults .|These well - documented side effects have restricted the use of this potent protease inhibitor in children .|DESIGN : A prospective study to monitor indinavir - related nephrotoxicity in a cohort of 30 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 - infected children treated with indinavir .|METHODS : Urinary pH , albumin , creatinine , the presence of erythrocytes , leukocytes , bacteria and crystals , and culture were analyzed every 3 months for 96 weeks .|Serum creatinine levels were routinely determined at the same time points .|Steady - state pharmacokinetics of indinavir were done at week 4 after the initiation of indinavir .|RESULTS : The cumulative incidence of persistent sterile leukocyturia ( > or = 75 cells / micro L in at least 2 consecutive visits ) after 96 weeks was 53 % .|Persistent sterile leukocyturia was frequently associated with a mild increase in the urine albumin / creatinine ratio and by microscopic hematuria .|The cumulative incidence of serum creatinine levels > 50 % above normal was 33 % after 96 weeks .|Children with persistent sterile leukocyturia more frequently had serum creatinine levels of 50 % above normal than those children without persistent sterile leukocyturia .|In children younger than 5 . 6 years , persistent sterile leukocyturia was significantly more frequent than in older children .|A higher cumulative incidence of persistent leukocyturia was found in children with an area under the curve > 19 mg / L x h or a peak serum level of indinavir > 12 mg / L .|In 4 children , indinavir was discontinued because of nephrotoxicity .|Subsequently , the serum creatinine levels decreased , the urine albumin / creatinine ratios returned to zero , and the leukocyturia disappeared within 3 months .|CONCLUSIONS : Children treated with indinavir have a high cumulative incidence of persistent sterile leukocyturia .|Children with persistent sterile leukocyturia more frequently had an increase in serum creatinine levels of > 50 % above normal .|Younger children have an additional risk for renal complications .|The impairment of the renal function in these children occurred in the absence of clinical symptoms of nephrolithiasis .|Indinavir - associated nephrotoxicity must be monitored closely , especially in children with risk factors such as persistent sterile leukocyturia , age < 5 . 6 years , an area under the curve of indinavir > 19 mg / L x h , and a C ( max ) > 12 mg / L .	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	70-71	67-68	D019469	indinavir|indinavir|indinavir|indinavir|indinavir|indinavir|indinavir|indinavir|indinavir|Indinavir|indinavir	Chemical	20:27:67:86:136:146:296:307:345:406:440	21:28:68:87:137:147:297:308:346:407:441	0:1:3:3:6:6:12:13:15:19:19	D007674	impaired renal function|nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxicity|impairment of the renal function|nephrotoxicity	Disease	6:70:312:388:409	9:71:313:393:410	0:3:13:18:19	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	318-319	312-313	D003404	creatinine|creatinine|creatinine|creatinine|creatinine|creatinine|creatinine|creatinine	Chemical	95:120:195:207:230:318:326:368	96:121:196:208:231:319:327:369	4:5:8:9:10:14:14:16	D007674	impaired renal function|nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxicity|impairment of the renal function|nephrotoxicity	Disease	6:70:312:388:409	9:71:313:393:410	0:3:13:18:19	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	20-21	10-17	D019469	indinavir|indinavir|indinavir|indinavir|indinavir|indinavir|indinavir|indinavir|indinavir|Indinavir|indinavir	Chemical	20:27:67:86:136:146:296:307:345:406:440	21:28:68:87:137:147:297:308:346:407:441	0:1:3:3:6:6:12:13:15:19:19	D015658	human immunodeficiency virus type 1 -

12498738	Carvedilol protects against doxorubicin - induced mitochondrial cardiomyopathy .|Several cytopathic mechanisms have been suggested to mediate the dose - limiting cumulative and irreversible cardiomyopathy caused by doxorubicin .|Recent evidence indicates that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are key factors in the pathogenic process .|The objective of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that carvedilol , a nonselective beta - adrenergic receptor antagonist with potent antioxidant properties , protects against the cardiac and hepatic mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction associated with subchronic doxorubicin toxicity .|Heart and liver mitochondria were isolated from rats treated for 7 weeks with doxorubicin ( 2 mg / kg sc / week ) , carvedilol ( 1 mg / kg ip / week ) , or the combination of the two drugs .|Heart mitochondria isolated from doxorubicin - treated rats exhibited depressed rates for state 3 respiration ( 336 + / - 26 versus 425 + / - 53 natom O / min / mg protein ) and a lower respiratory control ratio ( RCR ) ( 4 . 3 + / - 0 . 6 versus 5 . 8 + / - 0 . 4 ) compared with cardiac mitochondria isolated from saline - treated rats .|Mitochondrial calcium - loading capacity and the activity of NADH - dehydrogenase were also suppressed in cardiac mitochondria from doxorubicin - treated rats .|Doxorubicin treatment also caused a decrease in RCR for liver mitochondria ( 3 . 9 + / - 0 . 9 versus 5 . 6 + / - 0 . 7 for control rats ) and inhibition of hepatic cytochrome oxidase activity .|Coadministration of carvedilol decreased the extent of cellular vacuolization in cardiac myocytes and prevented the inhibitory effect of doxorubicin on mitochondrial respiration in both heart and liver .|Carvedilol also prevented the decrease in mitochondrial Ca ( 2 + ) loading capacity and the inhibition of the respiratory complexes of heart mitochondria caused by doxorubicin .|Carvedilol by itself did not affect any of the parameters measured for heart or liver mitochondria .|It is concluded that this protection by carvedilol against both the structural and functional cardiac tissue damage may afford significant clinical advantage in minimizing the dose - limiting mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyopathy that accompanies long - term doxorubicin therapy in cancer patients .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	0-1	7-8	C043211	Carvedilol|carvedilol|carvedilol|carvedilol|Carvedilol|Carvedilol|carvedilol	Chemical	0:57:110:274:300:328:352	1:58:111:275:301:329:353	0:3:4:8:9:10:11	D009202	cardiomyopathy|cardiomyopathy|cardiomyopathy	Disease	7:24:376	8:25:377	0:1:11	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	36-38	57-58	C043211	Carvedilol|carvedilol|carvedilol|carvedilol|Carvedilol|Carvedilol|carvedilol	Chemical	0:57:110:274:300:328:352	1:58:111:275:301:329:353	0:3:4:8:9:10:11	D028361	mitochondrial dysfunction|mitochondrial dysfunction	Disease	36:373	38:375	2:11	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	84-85	110-111	C043211	Carvedilol|carvedilol|carvedilol|carvedilol|Carvedilol|Carvedilol|carvedilol	Chemical	0:57:110:274:300:328:352	1:58:111:275:301:329:353	0:3:4:8:9:10:11	D064420	toxicity	Disease	84	85	3	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	352-353	385-386	C043211	Carvedilol|carvedilol|carvedilol|carvedilol|Carvedilol|Carvedilol|carvedilol	Chemical	0:57:110:274:300:328:352	1:58:111:275:301:329:353	0:3:4:8:9:10:11	D009369	cancer	Disease	385	386	11	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	24-25	27-28	D004317	doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin|Doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin	Chemical	3:27:83:99:133:224:229:290:326:382	4:28:84:100:134:225:230:291:327:383	0:1:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:11	D009202	cardiomyopathy|cardiomyopathy|cardiomyopathy	Disease	7:24:376	8:25:377	0:1:11	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	373-375	382-383	D004317	doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin|Doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin	Chemical	3:27:83:99:133:224:229:290:326:382	4:28:84:100:134:225:230:291:327:383	0:1:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:11	D028361	mitochondrial dysfunction|mitochondrial dysfunction	Disease	36:373	38:375	2:11	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	83-84	84-85	D004317	doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin|Doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin	Chemical	3:27:83:99:133:224:229:290:326:382	4:28:84:100:134:225:230:291:327:383	0:1:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:11	D064420	toxicity	Disease	84	85	3	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	382-383	385-386	D004317	doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin|Doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin|doxorubicin	Chemical	3:27:83:99:133:224:229:290:326:382	4:28:84:100:134:225:230:291:327:383	0:1:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:11	D009369	cancer	Disease	385	386	11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	376-377	307-308	D002118	calcium|Ca	Chemical	206:307	207:308	6:9	D009202	cardiomyopathy|cardiomyopathy|cardiomyopathy	Disease	7:24:376	8:25:377	0:1:11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	373-375	307-308	D002118	calcium|Ca	Chemical	206:307	207:308	6:9	D028361	mitochondrial dysfunction|mitochondrial dysfunction	Disease	36:373	38:375	2:11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	206-207	84-85	D002118	calcium|Ca	Chemical	206:307	207:308	6:9	D064420	toxicity	Disease	84	85	3	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	307-308	385-386	D002118	calcium|Ca	Chemical	206:307	207:308	6:9	D009369	cancer	Disease	385	386	11
12523489	Cocaine - induced hyperactivity is more influenced by adenosine receptor agonists than amphetamine - induced hyperactivity .|The influence of adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists on cocaine - and amphetamine - induced hyperactivity was examined in mice .|All adenosine receptor agonists significantly decreased the locomotor activity in mice , and the effects were dose - dependent .|It seems that adenosine A1 and A2 receptors might be involved in this reaction .|Moreover , all adenosine receptor agonists : 2 - p - ( 2 - carboxyethyl ) phenethylamino - 5 ' - N - ethylcarboxamidoadenosine ( CGS 21680 ) , A2A receptor agonist , N6 - cyclopentyladenosine ( CPA ) , A1 receptor agonist , and 5 ' - N - ethylcarboxamidoadenosine ( NECA ) , A2 / A1 receptor agonist significantly and dose - dependently decreased cocaine - induced locomotor activity .|CPA reduced cocaine action at the doses which , given alone , did not influence motility , while CGS 21680 and NECA decreased the action of cocaine at the doses which , given alone , decreased locomotor activity in animals .|These results suggest the involvement of both adenosine receptors in the action of cocaine although agonists of A1 receptors seem to have stronger influence on it .|The selective blockade of A2 adenosine receptor by DMPX ( 3 , 7 - dimethyl - 1 - propargylxanthine ) significantly enhanced cocaine - induced locomotor activity of animals .|Caffeine had similar action but the effect was not significant .|CPT ( 8 - cyclopentyltheophylline ) - - A1 receptor antagonist , did not show any influence in this test .|Similarly , all adenosine receptor agonists decreased amphetamine - induced hyperactivity , but at the higher doses than those which were active in cocaine - induced hyperactivity .|The selective blockade of A2 adenosine receptors ( DMPX ) and non - selective blockade of adenosine receptors ( caffeine ) significantly increased the action of amphetamine in the locomotor activity test .|Our results have shown that all adenosine receptor agonists ( A1 and A2 ) reduce cocaine - and amphetamine - induced locomotor activity and indicate that cocaine - induced hyperactivity is more influenced by adenosine receptor agonists ( particularly A1 receptors ) than amphetamine - induced hyperactivity .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	0-1	3-4	D003042	Cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine	Chemical	0:26:139:147:171:199:235:298:351:362	1:27:140:148:172:200:236:299:352:363	0:1:4:5:5:6:7:10:12:12	D006948	hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity	Disease	3:15:32:285:301:365:382	4:16:33:286:302:366:383	0:0:1:10:10:12:12	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	26-27	43-47	D003042	Cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine|cocaine	Chemical	0:26:139:147:171:199:235:298:351:362	1:27:140:148:172:200:236:299:352:363	0:1:4:5:5:6:7:10:12:12	D004409	decreased the locomotor activity	Disease	43	47	2	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	8-9	3-4	D000241	adenosine|adenosine|adenosine|adenosine|adenosine|adenosine|adenosine|adenosine|adenosine|adenosine|adenosine|adenosine	Chemical	8:20:39:61:76:193:218:278:308:319:342:370	9:21:40:62:77:194:219:279:309:320:343:371	0:1:2:3:4:6:7:10:11:11:12:12	D006948	hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity	Disease	3:15:32:285:301:365:382	4:16:33:286:302:366:383	0:0:1:10:10:12:12	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	15-16	12-13	D000661	amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine|amphetamine	Chemical	12:29:282:329:354:379	13:30:283:330:355:380	0:1:10:11:12:12	D006948	hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity|hyperactivity	Disease	3:15:32:285:301:365:382	4:16:33:286:302:366:383	0:0:1:10:10:12:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	80-97	32-33	C061282	2 -

12535818	Amiodarone and the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring permanent pacemaker in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation and prior myocardial infarction .|OBJECTIVES : The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of amiodarone in patients with atrial fibrillation ( AF ) increases the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring a permanent pacemaker .|BACKGROUND : Reports of severe bradyarrhythmia during amiodarone therapy are infrequent and limited to studies assessing the therapy 's use in the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias .|METHODS : A study cohort of 8 , 770 patients age > or = 65 years with a new diagnosis of AF was identified from a provincewide database of Quebec residents with a myocardial infarction ( MI ) between 1991 and 1999 .|Using a nested case - control design , 477 cases of bradyarrhythmia requiring a permanent pacemaker were matched ( 1 : 4 ) to 1 , 908 controls .|Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio ( OR ) of pacemaker insertion associated with amiodarone use , controlling for baseline risk factors and exposure to sotalol , Class I antiarrhythmic agents , beta - blockers , calcium channel blockers , and digoxin .|RESULTS : amiodarone use was associated with an increased risk of pacemaker insertion ( OR : 2 . 14 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 1 . 30 to 3 . 54 ) .|This effect was modified by gender , with a greater risk in women versus men ( OR : 3 . 86 , 95 % CI : 1 . 70 to 8 . 75 vs . OR : 1 . 52 , 95 % CI : 0 . 80 to 2 . 89 ) .|Digoxin was the only other medication associated with an increased risk of pacemaker insertion ( OR : 1 . 78 , 95 % CI : 1 . 37 to 2 . 31 ) .|CONCLUSIONS : This study suggests that the use of amiodarone in elderly patients with AF and a previous MI increases the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring a permanent pacemaker .|The finding of an augmented risk of pacemaker insertion in elderly women receiving amiodarone requires further investigation .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	58-59	60-61	D000638	Amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone	Chemical	0:34:60:172:203:335:368	1:35:61:173:204:336:369	0:1:2:5:6:9:10	D001919	bradyarrhythmia|bradyarrhythmia|bradyarrhythmia|bradyarrhythmia|bradyarrhythmia	Disease	5:47:58:136:349	6:48:59:137:350	0:1:2:4:9	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	34-35	38-40	D000638	Amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone	Chemical	0:34:60:172:203:335:368	1:35:61:173:204:336:369	0:1:2:5:6:9:10	D001281	atrial fibrillation|atrial fibrillation|AF|AF|AF	Disease	13:38:41:103:340	15:40:42:104:341	0:1:1:3:9	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	335-336	344-345	D000638	Amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone	Chemical	0:34:60:172:203:335:368	1:35:61:173:204:336:369	0:1:2:5:6:9:10	D009203	myocardial infarction|myocardial infarction|MI|MI	Disease	17:115:118:344	19:117:119:345	0:3:3:9	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	60-61	79-81	D000638	Amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone	Chemical	0:34:60:172:203:335:368	1:35:61:173:204:336:369	0:1:2:5:6:9:10	D001145	ventricular arrhythmias	Disease	79	81	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	183-184	136-137	D013015	sotalol	Chemical	183	184	5	D001919	bradyarrhythmia|bradyarrhythmia|bradyarrhythmia|bradyarrhythmia|bradyarrhythmia	Disease	5:47:58:136:349	6:48:59:137:350	0:1:2:4:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	194-195	136-137	D002118	calcium	Chemical	194	195	5	D001919	bradyarrhythmia|bradyarrhythmia|bradyarrhythmia|bradyarrhythmia|bradyarrhythmia	Disease	5:47:58:136:349	6:48:59:137:350	0:1:2:4:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	349-350	292-293	D004077	digoxin|Digoxin	Chemical	199:292	200:293	5:8	D001919	bradyarrhythmia|bradyarrhythmia|bradyarrhythmia|bradyarrhythmia|bradyarrhythmia	Disease	5:47:58:136:349	6:48:59:137:350	0:1:2:4:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	183-184	103-104	D013015	sotalol	Chemical	183	184	5	D001281	atrial fibrillation|atrial fibrillation|AF|AF|AF	Disease	13:38:41:103:340	15:40:42:104:341	0:1:1:3:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	194-195	103-104	D002118	calcium	Chemical	194	195	5	D001281	atrial fibrillation|atrial fibrillation|AF|AF|AF	Disease	13:38:41:103:340	15:40:42:104:341	0:1:1:3:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	340-341	292-293	D004077	digoxin|Digoxin	Chemical	199:292	200:293	5:8	D001281	atrial fibrillation|atrial fibrillation|AF|AF|AF	Disease	13:38:41:103:340	15:40:42:104:341	0:1:1:3:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	183-184	118-119	D013015	sotalol	Chemical	183	184	5	D009203	myocardial infarction|myocardial infarction|MI|MI	Disease	17:115:118:344	19:117:119:345	0:3:3:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	194-195	118-119	D002118	calcium	Chemical	194	195	5	D009203	myocardial infarction|myocardial infarction|MI|MI	Disease	17:115:118:344	19:117:119:345	0:3:3:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	344-345	292-293	D004077	digoxin|Digoxin	Chemical	199:292	200:293	5:8	D009203	myocardial infarction|myocardial infarction|MI|MI	Disease	17:115:118:344	19:117:119:345	0:3:3:9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	183-184	79-81	D013015	sotalol	Chemical	183	184	5	D001145	ventricular arrhythmias	Disease	79	81	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	194-195	79-81	D002118	calcium	Chemical	194	195	5	D001145	ventricular arrhythmias	Disease	79	81	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	199-200	79-81	D004077	digoxin|Digoxin	Chemical	199:292	200:293	5:8	D001145	ventricular arrhythmias	Disease	79	81	2

12677626	Central nervous system toxicity following the administration of levobupivacaine for lumbar plexus block : A report of two cases .|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : Central nervous system and cardiac toxicity following the administration of local anesthetics is a recognized complication of regional anesthesia .|Levobupivacaine , the pure S ( - ) enantiomer of bupivacaine , was developed to improve the cardiac safety profile of bupivacaine .|We describe 2 cases of grand mal seizures following accidental intravascular injection of levobupivacaine .|CASE REPORT : Two patients presenting for elective orthopedic surgery of the lower limb underwent blockade of the lumbar plexus via the posterior approach .|Immediately after the administration of levobupivacaine 0 . 5 % with epinephrine 2 . 5 microgram / mL , the patients developed grand mal seizures , despite negative aspiration for blood and no clinical signs of intravenous epinephrine administration .|The seizures were successfully treated with sodium thiopental in addition to succinylcholine in 1 patient .|Neither patient developed signs of cardiovascular toxicity .|Both patients were treated preoperatively with beta - adrenergic antagonist medications , which may have masked the cardiovascular signs of the unintentional intravascular administration of levobupivacaine with epinephrine .|CONCLUSIONS : Although levobupivacaine may have a safer cardiac toxicity profile than racemic bupivacaine , if adequate amounts of levobupivacaine reach the circulation , it will result in convulsions .|Plasma concentrations sufficient to result in central nervous system toxicity did not produce manifestations of cardiac toxicity in these 2 patients

12752472	Respiratory pattern in a rat model of epilepsy .|PURPOSE : Apnea is known to occur during seizures , but systematic studies of ictal respiratory changes in adults are few .|Data regarding respiratory pattern defects during interictal periods also are scarce .|Here we sought to generate information with regard to the interictal period in animals with pilocarpine - induced epilepsy .|METHODS : Twelve rats ( six chronically epileptic animals and six controls ) were anesthetized , given tracheotomies , and subjected to hyperventilation or hypoventilation conditions .|Breathing movements caused changes in thoracic volume and forced air to flow tidally through a pneumotachograph .|This flow was measured by using a differential pressure transducer , passed through a polygraph , and from this to a computer with custom software that derived ventilation ( VE ) , tidal volume ( VT ) , inspiratory time ( TI ) , expiratory time ( TE ) , breathing frequency ( f ) , and mean inspiratory flow ( VT / TI ) on a breath - by - breath basis .|RESULTS : The hyperventilation maneuver caused a decrease in spontaneous ventilation in pilocarpine - treated and control rats .|Although VE had a similar decrease in both groups , in the epileptic group , the decrease in VE was due to a significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) increase in TE peak in relation to that of the control animals .|The hypoventilation maneuver led to an increase in the arterial Paco2 , followed by an increase in VE .|In the epileptic group , the increase in VE was mediated by a significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) decrease in TE peak compared with the control group .|Systemic application of KCN , to evaluate the effects of peripheral chemoreception activation on ventilation , led to a similar increase in VE for both groups .|CONCLUSIONS : The data indicate that pilocarpine - treated animals have an altered ability to react to ( or compensate for ) blood gas changes with changes in ventilation and suggest that it is centrally determined .|We speculate on the possible relation of the current findings on treating different epilepsy - associated conditions .	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	61-62	58-59	D010862	pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine	Chemical	58:193:327	59:194:328	3:7:12	D004827	epilepsy|epilepsy|epileptic|epileptic|epileptic|epilepsy	Disease	7:61:70:212:265:371	8:62:71:213:266:372	0:3:4:8:10:13	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	58-59	11-12	D010862	pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine	Chemical	58:193:327	59:194:328	3:7:12	D001049	Apnea	Disease	11	12	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	58-59	17-18	D010862	pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine	Chemical	58:193:327	59:194:328	3:7:12	D012640	seizures	Disease	17	18	1	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	184-185	193-194	D010862	pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine	Chemical	58:193:327	59:194:328	3:7:12	D006985	hyperventilation|hyperventilation	Disease	85:184	86:185	4:7

15265979	Disruption of hepatic lipid homeostasis in mice after amiodarone treatment is associated with peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - alpha target gene activation .|Amiodarone , an efficacious and widely used antiarrhythmic agent , has been reported to cause hepatotoxicity in some patients .|To gain insight into the mechanism of this unwanted effect , mice were administered various doses of amiodarone and examined for changes in hepatic histology and gene regulation .|Amiodarone induced hepatomegaly , hepatocyte microvesicular lipid accumulation , and a significant decrease in serum triglycerides and glucose .|Northern blot analysis of hepatic RNA revealed a dose - dependent increase in the expression of a number of genes critical for fatty acid oxidation , lipoprotein assembly , and lipid transport .|Many of these genes are regulated by the peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - alpha ( PPARalpha ) , a ligand - activated nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor .|The absence of induction of these genes as well as hepatomegaly in PPARalpha knockout [ PPARalpha - / - ] mice indicated that the effects of amiodarone were dependent upon the presence of a functional PPARalpha gene .|Compared to wild - type mice , treatment of PPARalpha - / - mice with amiodarone resulted in an increased rate and extent of total body weight loss .|The inability of amiodarone to directly activate either human or mouse PPARalpha transiently expressed in human HepG2 hepatoma cells indicates that the effects of amiodarone on the function of this receptor were indirect .|Based upon these results , we conclude that amiodarone disrupts hepatic lipid homeostasis and that the increased expression of PPARalpha target genes is secondary to this toxic effect .|These results provide important new mechanistic information regarding the hepatotoxic effects of amiodarone and indicate that PPARalpha protects against amiodarone - induced hepatotoxicity .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	293-294	296-297	D000638	amiodarone|Amiodarone|amiodarone|Amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone	Chemical	8:24:61:73:180:207:224:245:263:296:303	9:25:62:74:181:208:225:246:264:297:304	0:1:2:3:6:7:8:8:9:10:10	D056486	hepatotoxicity|hepatotoxic|hepatotoxicity	Disease	39:293:306	40:294:307	1:10:10	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	73-74	75-76	D000638	amiodarone|Amiodarone|amiodarone|Amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone	Chemical	8:24:61:73:180:207:224:245:263:296:303	9:25:62:74:181:208:225:246:264:297:304	0:1:2:3:6:7:8:8:9:10:10	D006529	hepatomegaly|hepatomegaly	Disease	75:164	76:165	3:6	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	218-220	224-225	D000638	amiodarone|Amiodarone|amiodarone|Amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone	Chemical	8:24:61:73:180:207:224:245:263:296:303	9:25:62:74:181:208:225:246:264:297:304	0:1:2:3:6:7:8:8:9:10:10	D015431	weight loss	Disease	218	220	7	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	238-239	245-246	D000638	amiodarone|Amiodarone|amiodarone|Amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone|amiodarone	Chemical	8:24:61:73:180:207:224:245:263:296:303	9:25:62:74:181:208:225:246:264:297:304	0:1:2:3:6:7:8:8:9:10:10	D006528	hepatoma	Disease	238	239	8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	88-89	39-40	D014280	triglycerides	Chemical	88	89	3	D056486	hepatotoxicity|hepatotoxic|hepatotoxicity	Disease	39:293:306	40:294:307	1:10:10	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	90-91	39-40	D005947	glucose	Chemical	90	91	3	D056486	hepatotoxicity|hepatotoxic|hepatotoxicity	Disease	39:293:306	40:294:307	1:10:10	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	114-116	39-40	D005227	fatty acid	Chemical	114	116	4	D056486	hepatotoxicity|hepatotoxic|hepatotoxicity	Disease	39:293:306	40:294:307	1:10:10	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	88-89	75-76	D014280	triglycerides	Chemical	88	89	3	D006529	hepatomegaly|hepatomegaly	Disease	75:164	76:165	3:6	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	90-91	75-76	D005947	glucose	Chemical	90	91	3	D006529	hepatomegaly|hepatomegaly	Disease	75:164	76:165	3:6	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	114-116	75-76	D005227	fatty acid	Chemical	114	116	4	D006529	hepatomegaly|hepatomegaly	Disease	75:164	76:165	3:6	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	88-89	218-220	D014280	triglycerides	Chemical	88	89	3	D015431	weight loss	Disease	218	220	7	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	88-89	238-239	D014280	triglycerides	Chemical	88	89	3	D006528	hepatoma	Disease	238	239	8	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	90-91	218-220	D005947	glucose	Chemical	90	91	3	D015431	weight loss	Disease	218	220	7	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	90-91	238-239	D005947	glucose	Chemical	90	91	3	D006528	hepatoma	Disease	238	239	8	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	114-116	218-220	D005227	fatty acid	Chemical	114	116	4	D015431	weight loss	Disease	218	220	7	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	114-116	238-239	D005227	fatty acid	Chemical	114	116	4	D006528	hepatoma	Disease	238	239	8

15614572	Effects of the antidepressant trazodone , a 5 - HT 2A / 2C receptor antagonist , on dopamine - dependent behaviors in rats .|RATIONALE : 5 - Hydroxytryptamine , via stimulation of 5 - HT 2C receptors , exerts a tonic inhibitory influence on dopaminergic neurotransmission , whereas activation of 5 - HT 2A receptors enhances stimulated DAergic neurotransmission .|The antidepressant trazodone is a 5 - HT 2A / 2C receptor antagonist .|OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the effect of trazodone treatment on behaviors dependent on the functional status of the nigrostriatal DAergic system .|METHODS : The effect of pretreatment with trazodone on dexamphetamine - and apomorphine - induced oral stereotypies , on catalepsy induced by haloperidol and apomorphine ( 0 . 05 mg / kg , i . p . ) , on ergometrine - induced wet dog shake ( WDS ) behavior and fluoxetine - induced penile erections was studied in rats .|We also investigated whether trazodone induces catalepsy in rats .|RESULTS : Trazodone at 2 . 5 - 20 mg / kg i . p .|did not induce catalepsy , and did not antagonize apomorphine ( 1 . 5 and 3 mg / kg ) stereotypy and apomorphine ( 0 . 05 mg / kg ) - induced catalepsy .|However , pretreatment with 5 , 10 and 20 mg / kg i . p .|trazodone enhanced dexamphetamine stereotypy , and antagonized haloperidol catalepsy , ergometrine - induced WDS behavior and fluoxetine - induced penile erections .|Trazodone at 30 , 40 and 50 mg / kg i . p .|induced catalepsy and antagonized apomorphine and dexamphetamine stereotypies .|CONCLUSIONS : Our results indicate that trazodone at 2 . 5 - 20 mg / kg does not block pre - and postsynaptic striatal D2 DA receptors , while at 30 , 40 and 50 mg / kg it blocks postsynaptic striatal D2 DA receptors .|Furthermore , at 5 , 10 and 20 mg / kg , trazodone blocks 5 - HT 2A and 5 - HT 2C receptors .|We suggest that trazodone ( 5 , 10 and 20 mg / kg ) , by blocking the 5 - HT 2C receptors , releases the nigrostriatal DAergic neurons from tonic inhibition caused by 5 - HT , and thereby potentiates dexamphetamine stereotypy and antagonizes haloperidol catalepsy .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	104-105	112-114	D014196	trazodone|trazodone|trazodone|trazodone|trazodone|Trazodone|trazodone|Trazodone|trazodone|trazodone|trazodone	Chemical	4:63:82:104:162:170:235:257:286:338:354	5:64:83:105:163:171:236:258:287:339:355	0:2:3:4:5:6:9:10:12:13:14	D009062	oral stereotypies	Disease	112	114	4	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	162-163	164-165	D014196	trazodone|trazodone|trazodone|trazodone|trazodone|Trazodone|trazodone|Trazodone|trazodone|trazodone|trazodone	Chemical	4:63:82:104:162:170:235:257:286:338:354	5:64:83:105:163:171:236:258:287:339:355	0:2:3:4:5:6:9:10:12:13:14	D002375	catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy|catalepsy	Disease	116:164:187:217:243:272:397	117:165:188:218:244:273:398	4:5:7:7:9:11:14	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	66-69	112-114	D012701	5 -

15630069	Glucose metabolism in patients with schizophrenia treated with atypical antipsychotic agents : a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and minimal model analysis .|BACKGROUND : While the incidence of new - onset diabetes mellitus may be increasing in patients with schizophrenia treated with certain atypical antipsychotic agents , it remains unclear whether atypical agents are directly affecting glucose metabolism or simply increasing known risk factors for diabetes .|OBJECTIVE : To study the 2 drugs most clearly implicated ( clozapine and olanzapine ) and risperidone using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test .|DESIGN : A cross - sectional design in stable , treated patients with schizophrenia evaluated using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and the Bergman minimal model analysis .|SETTING : Subjects were recruited from an urban community mental health clinic and were studied at a general clinical research center .|Patients Fifty subjects signed informed consent and 41 underwent the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test .|Thirty - six nonobese subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder , matched by body mass index and treated with either clozapine , olanzapine , or risperidone , were included in the analysis .|MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Fasting plasma glucose and fasting serum insulin levels , insulin sensitivity index , homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance , and glucose effectiveness .|RESULTS : The mean + / - SD duration of treatment with the identified atypical antipsychotic agent was 68 . 3 + / - 28 . 9 months ( clozapine ) , 29 . 5 + / - 17 . 5 months ( olanzapine ) , and 40 . 9 + / - 33 . 7 ( risperidone ) .|Fasting serum insulin concentrations differed among groups ( F ( 33 ) = 3 . 35 ; P = . 047 ) ( clozapine > olanzapine > risperidone ) with significant differences between clozapine and risperidone ( t ( 33 ) = 2 . 32 ; P = . 03 ) and olanzapine and risperidone ( t ( 33 ) = 2 . 15 ; P = . 04 ) .|There was a significant difference in insulin sensitivity index among groups ( F ( 33 ) = 10 . 66 ; P < . 001 ) ( clozapine < olanzapine < risperidone ) , with subjects who received clozapine and olanzapine exhibiting significant insulin resistance compared with subjects who were treated with risperidone ( clozapine vs risperidone , t ( 33 ) = - 4 . 29 ; P < . 001 ; olanzapine vs risperidone , t ( 33 ) = - 3 . 62 ; P = . 001 [ P < . 001 ] ) .|The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance also differed significantly among groups ( F ( 33 ) = 4 . 92 ; P = . 01 ) ( clozapine > olanzapine > risperidone ) ( clozapine vs risperidone , t ( 33 ) = 2 . 94 ; P = . 006 ; olanzapine vs risperidone , t ( 33 ) = 2 . 42 ; P = . 02 ) .|There was a significant difference among groups in glucose effectiveness ( F ( 30 ) = 4 . 18 ; P = . 02 ) ( clozapine < olanzapine < risperidone ) with significant differences between clozapine and risperidone ( t ( 30 ) = - 2 . 59 ; P = . 02 ) and olanzapine and risperidone ( t ( 30 ) = - 2 . 34 , P = . 03 ) .|CONCLUSIONS : Both nonobese clozapine - and olanzapine - treated groups displayed significant insulin resistance and impairment of glucose effectiveness compared with risperidone - treated subjects .|Patients taking clozapine and olanzapine must be examined for insulin resistance and its consequences

15815446	Focal cerebral ischemia in rats : effect of phenylephrine - induced hypertension during reperfusion .|After 180 min of temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion in spontaneously hypertensive rats , the effect of phenylephrine - induced hypertension on ischemic brain injury and blood - brain barrier permeability was determined .|Blood pressure was manipulated by one of the following schedules during 120 min of reperfusion : Control , normotensive reperfusion ; 90 / hypertension ( 90 / HTN ) , blood pressure was increased by 35 mm Hg during the initial 90 min of reperfusion only ; 15 / hypertension ( 15 / HTN ) , normotensive reperfusion for 30 min followed by 15 min of hypertension and 75 min of normotension .|Part A , for eight rats in each group brain injury was evaluated by staining tissue using 2 , 3 , 5 - triphenyltetrazolium chloride and edema was evaluated by microgravimetry .|Part B , for eight different rats in each group blood - brain barrier permeability was evaluated by measuring the amount and extent of extravasation of Evans Blue dye .|Brain injury ( percentage of the ischemic hemisphere ) was less in the 15 / HTN group ( 16 + / - 6 , mean + / - SD ) versus the 90 / HTN group ( 30 + / - 6 ) , which was in turn less than the control group ( 42 + / - 5 ) .|Specific gravity was greater in the 15 / HTN group ( 1 . 043 + / - 0 . 002 ) versus the 90 / HTN ( 1 . 036 + / - 0 . 003 ) and control ( 1 . 037 + / - 0 . 003 ) groups .|Evans Blue ( mug g - 1 of brain tissue ) was greater in the 90 / HTN group ( 24 . 4 + / - 6 . 0 ) versus the control group ( 12 . 3 + / - 4 . 1 ) , which was in turn greater than the 15 / HTN group ( 7 . 3 + / - 3 . 2 ) .|This study supports a hypothesis that during reperfusion , a short interval of hypertension decreases brain injury and edema ; and that sustained hypertension increases the risk of vasogenic edema .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	8-9	1-3	D010656	phenylephrine|phenylephrine	Chemical	8:32	9:33	0:1	D002545	cerebral ischemia|ischemic hemisphere	Disease	1:190	3:192	0:5	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	190-192	139-147	C009591	2 , 3 , 5 - triphenyltetrazolium chloride	Chemical	139	147	3	D002545	cerebral ischemia|ischemic hemisphere	Disease	1:190	3:192	0:5	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	297-299	190-192	D005070	Evans Blue	Chemical	297	299	7	D002545	cerebral ischemia|ischemic hemisphere	Disease	1:190	3:192	0:5	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	8-9	11-12	D010656	phenylephrine|phenylephrine	Chemical	8:32	9:33	0:1	D006973	hypertension|hypertensive|hypertension|hypertension|HTN|hypertension|HTN|hypertension|HTN|HTN|HTN|HTN|HTN|HTN|hypertension|hypertension	Disease	11:26:35:72:76:98:102:115:199:218:253:270:314:352:379:389	12:27:36:73:77:99:103:116:200:219:254:271:315:353:380:390	0:1:1:2:2:2:2:2:5:5:6:6:7:7:8:8	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	20-24	32-33	D010656	phenylephrine|phenylephrine	Chemical	8:32	9:33	0:1	D020244	middle cerebral artery occlusion	Disease	20	24	1	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	32-33	37-40	D010656	phenylephrine|phenylephrine	Chemical	8:32	9:33	0:1	D001930	ischemic brain injury|brain injury|Brain injury|brain injury	Disease	37:131:184:381	40:133:186:383	1:3:5:8	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	32-33	148-149	D010656	phenylephrine|phenylephrine	Chemical	8:32	9:33	0:1	D004487	edema|edema	Disease	148:384	149:385	3:8	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	32-33	394-396	D010656	phenylephrine|phenylephrine	Chemical	8:32	9:33	0:1	D001929	vasogenic edema	Disease	394	396	8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	139-147	115-116	C009591	2 , 3 , 5 - triphenyltetrazolium chloride	Chemical	139	147	3	D006973	hypertension|hypertensive|hypertension|hypertension|HTN|hypertension|HTN|hypertension|HTN|HTN|HTN|HTN|HTN|HTN|hypertension|hypertension	Disease	11:26:35:72:76:98:102:115:199:218:253:270:314:352:379:389	12:27:36:73:77:99:103:116:200:219:254:271:315:353:380:390	0:1:1:2:2:2:2:2:5:5:6:6:7:7:8:8	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	314-315	297-299	D005070	Evans Blue	Chemical	297	299	7	D006973	hypertension|hypertensive|hypertension|hypertension|HTN|hypertension|HTN|hypertension|HTN|HTN|HTN|HTN|HTN|HTN|hypertension|hypertension	Disease	11:26:35:72:76:98:102:115:199:218:253:270:314:352:379:389	12:27:36:73:77:99:103:116:200:219:254:271:315:353:380:390	0:1:1:2:2:2:2:2:5:5:6:6:7:7:8:8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	139-147	20-24	C009591	2 , 3 , 5 - triphenyltetrazolium chloride	Chemical	139	147	3	D020244	middle cerebral artery occlusion	Disease	20	24	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	297-299	20-24	D005070	Evans Blue	Chemical	297	299	7	D020244	middle cerebral artery occlusion	Disease	20	24	1	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	139-147	131-133	C009591	2 , 3 , 5 - triphenyltetrazolium chloride	Chemical	139	147	3	D001930	ischemic brain injury|brain injury|Brain injury|brain injury	Disease	37:131:184:381	40:133:186:383	1:3:5:8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	381-383	297-299	D005070	Evans Blue	Chemical	297	299	7	D001930	ischemic brain injury|brain injury|Brain injury|brain injury	Disease	37:131:184:381	40:133:186:383	1:3:5:8	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	139-147	148-149	C009591	2 , 3 , 5 - triphenyltetrazolium chloride	Chemical	139	147	3	D004487	edema|edema	Disease	148:384	149:385	3:8	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	139-147	394-396	C009591	2 , 3 , 5 - triphenyltetrazolium chloride	Chemical	139	147	3	D001929	vasogenic edema	Disease	394	396	8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	384-385	297-299	D005070	Evans Blue	Chemical	297	299	7	D004487	edema|edema	Disease	148:384	149:385	3:8	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	297-299	394-396	D005070	Evans Blue	Chemical	297	299	7	D001929	vasogenic edema	Disease	394	396	8

steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) are commonly involved in such reactions .|Celecoxib ( CE ) is a novel drug , with high selectivity and affinity for COX - 2 enzyme .|OBJECTIVE : We evaluated the tolerability of CE in a group of patients with documented history of adverse cutaneous reactions to P and N associated or not to classic NSAIDs .|METHODS : We studied 9 patients with hypersensitivity to P and N with or without associated reactions to classic NSAIDs .|The diagnosis of P and N - induced skin reactions was based in vivo challenge .|The placebo was blindly administered at the beginning of each challenge .|After three days , a cumulative dosage of 200 mg of CE in refracted doses were given .|After 2 - 3 days , a single dose of 200 mg was administered .|All patients were observed for 6 hours after each challenge , and controlled again after 24 hours to exclude delayed reactions .|The challenge was considered positive if one or more of the following appeared : erythema , rush or urticaria - angioedema .|RESULTS : No reaction was observed with placebo and eight patients ( 88 . 8 % ) tolerated CE .|Only one patient developed a moderate angioedema of the lips .|CONCLUSION : Only one hypersensitivity reaction to CE was documented among 9 P and N - highly NSAIDs intolerant patients .|Thus , we conclude that CE is a reasonably safe alternative to be used in subjects who do not tolerate P and N .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	2-3	7-9	C105934	celecoxib|Celecoxib|CE|CE|CE|CE|CE|CE	Chemical	2:88:90:115:199:283:303:322	3:89:91:116:200:284:304:323	0:4:4:5:9:13:15:16	D003875	skin reactions|cutaneous reactions|skin reactions	Disease	7:126:168	9:128:170	0:5:7	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	300-301	303-304	C105934	celecoxib|Celecoxib|CE|CE|CE|CE|CE|CE	Chemical	2:88:90:115:199:283:303:322	3:89:91:116:200:284:304:323	0:4:4:5:9:13:15:16	D004342	hypersensitivity|hypersensitivity|hypersensitivity	Disease	59:146:300	60:147:301	2:6:15	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	257-258	283-284	C105934	celecoxib|Celecoxib|CE|CE|CE|CE|CE|CE	Chemical	2:88:90:115:199:283:303:322	3:89:91:116:200:284:304:323	0:4:4:5:9:13:15:16	D004890	erythema	Disease	257	258	12	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	261-262	283-284	C105934	celecoxib|Celecoxib|CE|CE|CE|CE|CE|CE	Chemical	2:88:90:115:199:283:303:322	3:89:91:116:200:284:304:323	0:4:4:5:9:13:15:16	D014581	urticaria	Disease	261	262	12	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	283-284	291-292	C105934	celecoxib|Celecoxib|CE|CE|CE|CE|CE|CE	Chemical	2:88:90:115:199:283:303:322	3:89:91:116:200:284:304:323	0:4:4:5:9:13:15:16	D000799	angioedema|angioedema	Disease	263:291	264:292	12:14	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	10-11	7-9	D000082	acetaminophen|paracetamol|Acetaminophen|paracetamol|P|P|P|P|P|P	Chemical	10:12:31:33:36:129:148:163:308:337	11:13:32:34:37:130:149:164:309:338	0:0:1:1:1:5:6:7:15:16	D003875	skin reactions|cutaneous reactions|skin reactions	Disease	7:126:168	9:128:170	0:5:7	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	168-170	165-166	C012655	nimesulide|Nimesulide|N|N|N|N|N|N	Chemical	15:39:41:131:150:165:310:339	16:40:42:132:151:166:311:340	0:1:1:5:6:7:15:16	D003875	skin reactions|cutaneous reactions|skin reactions	Disease	7:126:168	9:128:170	0:5:7	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	146-147	148-149	D000082	acetaminophen|paracetamol|Acetaminophen|paracetamol|P|P|P|P|P|P	Chemical	10:12:31:33:36:129:148:163:308:337	11:13:32:34:37:130:149:164:309:338	0:0:1:1:1:5:6:7:15:16	D004342	hypersensitivity|hypersensitivity|hypersensitivity	Disease	59:146:300	60:147:301	2:6:15	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	257-258	308-309	D000082	acetaminophen|paracetamol|Acetaminophen|paracetamol|P|P|P|P|P|P	Chemical	10:12:31:33:36:129:148:163:308:337	11:13:32:34:37:130:149:164:309:338	0:0:1:1:1:5:6:7:15:16	D004890	erythema	Disease	257	258	12	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	261-262	308-309	D000082	acetaminophen|paracetamol|Acetaminophen|paracetamol|P|P|P|P|P|P	Chemical	10:12:31:33:36:129:148:163:308:337	11:13:32:34:37:130:149:164:309:338	0:0:1:1:1:5:6:7:15:16	D014581	urticaria	Disease	261	262	12	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	291-292	308-309	D000082	acetaminophen|paracetamol|Acetaminophen|paracetamol|P|P|P|P|P|P	Chemical	10:12:31:33:36:129:148:163:308:337	11:13:32:34:37:130:149:164:309:338	0:0:1:1:1:5:6:7:15:16	D000799	angioedema|angioedema	Disease	263:291	264:292	12:14	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	146-147	150-151	C012655	nimesulide|Nimesulide|N|N|N|N|N|N	Chemical	15:39:41:131:150:165:310:339	16:40:42:132:151:166:311:340	0:1:1:5:6:7:15:16	D004342	hypersensitivity|hypersensitivity|hypersensitivity	Disease	59:146:300	60:147:301	2:6:15	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	257-258	310-311	C012655	nimesulide|Nimesulide|N|N|N|N|N|N	Chemical	15:39:41:131:150:165:310:339	16:40:42:132:151:166:311:340	0:1:1:5:6:7:15:16	D004890	erythema	Disease	257	258	12	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	261-262	310-311	C012655	nimesulide|Nimesulide|N|N|N|N|N|N	Chemical	15:39:41:131:150:165:310:339	16:40:42:132:151:166:311:340	0:1:1:5:6:7:15:16	D014581	urticaria	Disease	261	262	12	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	291-292	310-311	C012655	nimesulide|Nimesulide|N|N|N|N|N|N	Chemical	15:39:41:131:150:165:310:339	16:40:42:132:151:166:311:340	0:1:1:5:6:7:15:16	D000799	angioedema|angioedema	Disease	263:291	264:292	12:14

15987266	Growth - associated protein 43 expression in hippocampal molecular layer of chronic epileptic rats treated with cycloheximide .|PURPOSE : GAP43 has been thought to be linked with mossy fiber sprouting ( MFS ) in various experimental models of epilepsy .|To investigate how GAP43 expression ( GAP43 - ir ) correlates with MFS , we assessed the intensity ( densitometry ) and extension ( width ) of GAP43 - ir in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus ( IML ) of rats subject to status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine ( Pilo ) , previously injected or not with cycloheximide ( CHX ) , which has been shown to inhibit MFS .|METHODS : CHX was injected before the Pilo injection in adult Wistar rats .|The Pilo group was injected with the same drugs , except for CHX .|Animals were killed between 30 and 60 days later , and brain sections were processed for GAP43 immunohistochemistry .|RESULTS : Densitometry showed no significant difference regarding GAP43 - ir in the IML between Pilo , CHX + Pilo , and control groups .|However , the results of the width of the GAP43 - ir band in the IML showed that CHX + Pilo and control animals had a significantly larger band ( p = 0 . 03 ) as compared with that in the Pilo group .|CONCLUSIONS : Our current finding that animals in the CHX + Pilo group have a GAP43 - ir band in the IML , similar to that of controls , reinforces prior data on the blockade of MFS in these animals .|The change in GAP43 - ir present in Pilo - treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP - 43 .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	16-17	12-13	D003513	cycloheximide|cycloheximide|CHX|CHX|CHX|CHX|CHX|CHX	Chemical	16:101:103:116:140:178:204:240	17:102:104:117:141:179:205:241	0:2:2:3:4:6:7:8	D004827	epileptic|epilepsy	Disease	12:39	13:40	0:1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	91-92	39-40	D010862	pilocarpine|Pilo|Pilo|Pilo|Pilo|Pilo|Pilo|Pilo|Pilo|Pilo	Chemical	91:93:121:129:176:180:206:228:242:280	92:94:122:130:177:181:207:229:243:281	2:2:3:4:6:6:7:7:8:9	D004827	epileptic|epilepsy	Disease	12:39	13:40	0:1	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	87-89	101-102	D003513	cycloheximide|cycloheximide|CHX|CHX|CHX|CHX|CHX|CHX	Chemical	16:101:103:116:140:178:204:240	17:102:104:117:141:179:205:241	0:2:2:3:4:6:7:8	D013226	status epilepticus	Disease	87	89	2	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	91-92	87-89	D010862	pilocarpine|Pilo|Pilo|Pilo|Pilo|Pilo|Pilo|Pilo|Pilo|Pilo	Chemical	91:93:121:129:176:180:206:228:242:280	92:94:122:130:177:181:207:229:243:281	2:2:3:4:6:6:7:7:8:9	D013226	status epilepticus	Disease	87	89	2
15991002	Nicotine antagonizes caffeine - but not pentylenetetrazole - induced anxiogenic effect in mice .|RATIONALE : Nicotine and caffeine are widely consumed licit psychoactive drugs worldwide .|Epidemiological studies showed that they were generally used concurrently .|Although some studies in experimental animals indicate clear pharmacological interactions between them , no studies have shown a specific interaction on anxiety responses .|OBJECTIVES : The present study investigates the effects of nicotine on anxiety induced by caffeine and another anxiogenic drug , pentylenetetrazole , in mice .|The elevated plus - maze ( EPM ) test was used to evaluate the effects of drugs on anxiety .|METHODS : Adult male Swiss Webster mice ( 25 - 32 g ) were given nicotine ( 0 . 05 - 0 . 25 mg / kg s . c . ) or saline 10 min before caffeine ( 70 mg / kg i . p . ) or pentylenetetrazole ( 15 and 30 mg / kg i . p . ) injections .|After 15 min , mice were evaluated for their open - and closed - arm time and entries on the EPM for a 10 - min session .|Locomotor activity was recorded for individual groups by using the same treatment protocol with the EPM test .|RESULTS : Nicotine ( 0 . 05 - 0 . 25 mg / kg ) itself did not produce any significant effect in the EPM test , whereas caffeine ( 70 mg / kg ) and pentylenetetrazole ( 30 mg / kg ) produced an anxiogenic effect , apparent with decreases in open - arm time and entry .|Nicotine ( 0 . 25 mg / kg ) pretreatment blocked the caffeine - but not pentylenetetrazole - induced anxiety .|Administration of each drug and their combinations did not produce any effect on locomotor activity .|CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggest that the antagonistic effect of nicotine on caffeine - induced anxiety is specific to caffeine , instead of a non - specific anxiolytic effect .|Thus , it may extend the current findings on the interaction between nicotine and caffeine .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	70-71	72-73	D009538	Nicotine|Nicotine|nicotine|nicotine|Nicotine|Nicotine|nicotine|nicotine	Chemical	0:16:70:121:218:275:322:354	1:17:71:122:219:276:323:355	0:1:4:6:9:10:12:13	D001008	anxiety|anxiety|anxiety|anxiety|anxiety	Disease	58:72:104:294:327	59:73:105:295:328	3:4:5:10:12	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	72-73	75-76	D002110	caffeine|caffeine|caffeine|caffeine|caffeine|caffeine|caffeine|caffeine|caffeine	Chemical	2:18:75:143:244:287:324:331:356	3:19:76:144:245:288:325:332:357	0:1:4:6:9:10:12:12:13	D001008	anxiety|anxiety|anxiety|anxiety|anxiety	Disease	58:72:104:294:327	59:73:105:295:328	3:4:5:10:12	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	291-292	294-295	D010433	pentylenetetrazole|pentylenetetrazole|pentylenetetrazole|pentylenetetrazole|pentylenetetrazole	Chemical	6:81:155:252:291	7:82:156:253:292	0:4:6:9:10	D001008	anxiety|anxiety|anxiety|anxiety|anxiety	Disease	58:72:104:294:327	59:73:105:295:328	3:4:5:10:12
16034922	Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women .|BACKGROUND : Hormone therapy ( HT ) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms .|It has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease , osteoporosis and dementia in older women but the evidence supporting its use for these indications is largely observational .|OBJECTIVES : To assess the effect of long - term HT on mortality , heart disease , venous thromboembolism , stroke , transient ischaemic attacks , breast cancer , colorectal cancer , ovarian cancer , endometrial cancer , gallbladder disease , cognitive function , dementia , fractures and quality of life .|SEARCH STRATEGY : We searched the following databases up to November 2004 : the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Biological Abstracts .|Relevant non - indexed journals and conference abstracts were also searched .|SELECTION CRITERIA : Randomised double - blind trials of HT ( oestrogens with or without progestogens ) versus placebo , taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women .|DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS : Fifteen RCTs were included .|Trials were assessed for quality and two review authors extracted data independently .|They calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes .|Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta - analysis for most outcomes .|MAIN RESULTS : All the statistically significant results were derived from the two biggest trials .|In relatively healthy women , combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism or coronary event ( after one year 's use ) , stroke ( after 3 years ) , breast cancer ( after 5 years ) and gallbladder disease .|Long - term oestrogen - only HT also significantly increased the risk of stroke and gallbladder disease .|Overall , the only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and colon cancer with long - term use .|Among relatively healthy women over 65 years taking continuous combined HT , there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia .|Among women with cardiovascular disease , long - term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism .|No trials focussed specifically on younger women .|However , one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year - old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen - only HT , versus similar - sized placebo groups .|The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous HT ; their absolute risk remained very low .|AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS : HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease .|We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control , though short -

16112787	In vivo evidences suggesting the role of oxidative stress in pathogenesis of vancomycin - induced nephrotoxicity : protection by erdosteine .|The aims of this study were to examine vancomycin ( VCM ) - induced oxidative stress that promotes production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and to investigate the role of erdosteine , an expectorant agent , which has also antioxidant properties , on kidney tissue against the possible VCM - induced renal impairment in rats .|Rats were divided into three groups : sham , VCM and VCM plus erdosteine .|VCM was administrated intraperitoneally ( i . p . ) with 200mgkg ( - 1 ) twice daily for 7 days .|Erdosteine was administered orally .|VCM administration to control rats significantly increased renal malondialdehyde ( MDA ) and urinary N - acetyl - beta - d - glucosaminidase ( NAG , a marker of renal tubular injury ) excretion but decreased superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) and catalase ( CAT ) activities .|Erdosteine administration with VCM injections caused significantly decreased renal MDA and urinary NAG excretion , and increased SOD activity , but not CAT activity in renal tissue when compared with VCM alone .|Erdosteine showed histopathological protection against VCM -

year - old man with 5 - FU - induced cardiotoxicity , in whom a high serum level of alpha - fluoro - beta - alanine ( FBAL ) was observed .|The patient , who had unresectable colon cancer metastases to the liver and lung , was referred to us for chemotherapy from an affiliated hospital ; he had no cardiac history .|After admission , the patient received a continuous intravenous infusion of 5 - FU ( 1000 mg / day ) , during which precordial pain with right bundle branch block occurred concomitantly with a high serum FBAL concentration of 1955 ng / ml .|Both the precordial pain and the electrocardiographic changes disappeared spontaneously after the discontinuation of 5 - FU .|As the precordial pain in this patient was considered to have been due to 5 - FU - induced cardiotoxicity , the administration of 5 - FU was abandoned .|Instead , oral administration of S - 1 ( a derivative of 5 - FU ) , at 200 mg / day twice a week , was instituted , because S - 1 has a strong inhibitory effect on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase , which catalyzes the degradative of 5 - FU into FBAL .|The serum FBAL concentration subsequently decreased to 352 ng / ml , the same as the value measured on the first day of S - 1 administration .|Thereafter , no cardiac symptoms were observed .|The patient achieved a partial response 6 months after the initiation of the S - 1 treatment .|The experience of this case , together with a review of the literature , suggests that FBAL is related to 5 - FU - induced cardiotoxicity .|S - 1 may be administered safely to patients with 5 - FU - induced cardiotoxicity .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	0-3	3-4	D005472	5 - Fluorouracil|5 - fluorouracil|5 - FU|5 - FU|5 -

16565833	The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .|PURPOSE : Despite its well - known cardiotoxicity , the anthracyclin doxorubicin ( DOX ) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent .|DOX - induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX .|Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system .|The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside ( monoHER ) showed cardioprotection against DOX - induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties .|Because of the relatively short final half - life of monoHER ( about 30 min ) , it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER .|Therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect .|METHODS : Six groups of 6 BALB / c mice were treated with saline , DOX alone or DOX ( 4 mg / kg i . v . ) preceded by monoHER ( 500 mg / kg i . p . ) with an interval of 10 , 30 , 60 or 120 min .|After a 6 - week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks , the mice were sacrificed .|Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy , after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham ( in Cancer Treat Rep 62 ( 6 ) : 865 - 872 , 1978 ) .|Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .|RESULTS : The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9 . 6 - fold ( 95 % CI 4 . 4 - 21 . 0 ) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group .|The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1 . 6 to 2 . 8 ( mean 2 . 2 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 -

17035713	Chloroacetaldehyde as a sulfhydryl reagent : the role of critical thiol groups in ifosfamide nephropathy .|Chloroacetaldehyde ( CAA ) is a metabolite of the alkylating agent ifosfamide ( IFO ) and putatively responsible for renal damage following anti - tumor therapy with IFO .|Depletion of sulfhydryl ( SH ) groups has been reported from cell culture , animal and clinical studies .|In this work the effect of CAA on human proximal tubule cells in primary culture ( hRPTEC ) was investigated .|Toxicity of CAA was determined by protein content , cell number , LDH release , trypan blue exclusion assay and caspase - 3 activity .|Free thiols were measured by the method of Ellman .|CAA reduced hRPTEC cell number and protein , induced a loss in free intracellular thiols and an increase in necrosis markers .|CAA but not acrolein inhibited the cysteine proteases caspase - 3 , caspase - 8 and cathepsin B .|Caspase activation by cisplatin was inhibited by CAA .|In cells stained with fluorescent dyes targeting lysosomes , CAA induced an increase in lysosomal size and lysosomal leakage .|The effects of CAA on cysteine protease activities and thiols could be reproduced in cell lysate .|Acidification , which slowed the reaction of CAA with thiol donors , could also attenuate effects of CAA on necrosis markers , thiol depletion and cysteine protease inhibition in living cells .|Thus , CAA directly reacts with cellular protein and non - protein thiols , mediating its toxicity on hRPTEC .|This effect can be reduced by acidification .|Therefore , urinary acidification could be an option to prevent IFO nephropathy in patients

17042797	Stereological methods reveal the robust size and stability of ectopic hilar granule cells after pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus in the adult rat .|Following status epilepticus in the rat , dentate granule cell neurogenesis increases greatly , and many of the new neurons appear to develop ectopically , in the hilar region of the hippocampal formation .|It has been suggested that the ectopic hilar granule cells could contribute to the spontaneous seizures that ultimately develop after status epilepticus .|However , the population has never been quantified , so it is unclear whether it is substantial enough to have a strong influence on epileptogenesis .|To quantify this population , the total number of ectopic hilar granule cells was estimated using unbiased stereology at different times after pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus .|The number of hilar neurons immunoreactive for Prox - 1 , a granule - cell - specific marker , was estimated using the optical fractionator method .|The results indicate that the size of the hilar ectopic granule cell population after status epilepticus is substantial , and stable over time .|Interestingly , the size of the population appears to be correlated with the frequency of behavioral seizures , because animals with more ectopic granule cells in the hilus have more frequent behavioral seizures .|The hilar ectopic granule cell population does not appear to vary systematically across the septotemporal axis , although it is associated with an increase in volume of the hilus .|The results provide new insight into the potential role of ectopic hilar granule cells in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	14-15	17-19	D010862	pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine	Chemical	14:129:266	15:130:267	0:4:9	D013226	status epilepticus|status epilepticus|status epilepticus|status epilepticus|status epilepticus	Disease	17:25:78:132:176	19:27:80:134:178	0:1:2:4:6	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	218-219	266-267	D010862	pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine	Chemical	14:129:266	15:130:267	0:4:9	D012640	seizures|seizures|seizures	Disease	73:202:218	74:203:219	2:7:7	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	266-267	269-272	D010862	pilocarpine|pilocarpine|pilocarpine	Chemical	14:129:266	15:130:267	0:4:9	D004833	temporal lobe epilepsy	Disease	269	272	9

17255138	Risks and benefits of COX - 2 inhibitors vs non - selective NSAIDs : does their cardiovascular risk exceed their gastrointestinal benefit ? A retrospective cohort study .|OBJECTIVES : The risk of acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) with COX - 2 inhibitors may offset their gastrointestinal ( GI ) benefit compared with non - selective ( NS ) non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) .|We aimed to compare the risks of hospitalization for AMI and GI bleeding among elderly patients using COX - 2 inhibitors , NS - NSAIDs and acetaminophen .|METHODS : We conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative data of patients > or = 65 years of age who filled a prescription for NSAID or acetaminophen during 1999 - 2002 .|Outcomes were compared using Cox regression models with time - dependent exposures .|RESULTS : Person - years of exposure among non - users of aspirin were : 75 , 761 to acetaminophen , 42 , 671 to rofecoxib 65 , 860 to celecoxib , and 37 , 495 to NS - NSAIDs .|Among users of aspirin , they were : 14 , 671 to rofecoxib , 22 , 875 to celecoxib , 9 , 832 to NS - NSAIDs and 38 , 048 to acetaminophen .|Among non - users of aspirin , the adjusted hazard ratios ( 95 % confidence interval ) of hospitalization for AMI / GI vs the acetaminophen ( with no aspirin ) group were : rofecoxib 1 . 27 ( 1 . 13 , 1 . 42 ) , celecoxib 0 . 93 ( 0 . 83 , 1 . 03 ) , naproxen 1 . 59 ( 1 . 31 , 1 . 93 ) , diclofenac 1 . 17 ( 0 . 99 , 1 . 38 ) and ibuprofen 1 . 05 ( 0 . 74 , 1 . 51 ) .|Among users of aspirin , they were : rofecoxib 1 . 73 ( 1 . 52 , 1 . 98 ) , celecoxib 1 . 34 ( 1 . 19 , 1 . 52 ) , ibuprofen 1 . 51 ( 0 . 95 , 2 . 41 ) , diclofenac 1 . 69 ( 1 . 35 , 2 . 10 ) , naproxen 1 . 35 ( 0 . 97 , 1 . 88 ) and acetaminophen 1 . 29 ( 1 . 17 , 1 . 42 ) .|CONCLUSION : Among non - users of aspirin , naproxen seemed to carry the highest risk for AMI / GI bleeding .|The AMI / GI toxicity of celecoxib was similar to that of acetaminophen and seemed to be better than those of rofecoxib and NS - NSAIDs .|Among users of aspirin , both celecoxib and naproxen seemed to be the least toxic .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	37-38	40-44	D052246	COX - 2 inhibitors|COX - 2 inhibitors|COX - 2 inhibitors	Chemical	4:40:88	8:44:92	0:1:2	D009203	acute myocardial infarction|AMI|AMI|AMI|AMI|AMI	Disease	33:37:80:240:433:439	36:38:81:241:434:440	1:1:2:7:9:10	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	82-84	88-92	D052246	COX -

17297207	Quinine - induced arrhythmia in a patient with severe malaria .|It was reported that there was a case of severe malaria patient with jaundice who presented with arrhythmia ( premature ventricular contraction ) while getting quinine infusion was reported .|A man , 25 years old , was admitted to hospital with high fever , chill , vomiting , jaundice .|The patient was fully conscious , blood pressure 120 / 80 mmHg , pulse rate 100 x / minute , regular .|On admission , laboratory examination showed Plasmodium falciparum ( + + + + ) , total bilirubin 8 . 25 mg / dL , conjugated bilirubin 4 . 36 mg / dL , unconjugated bilirubin 3 . 89 mg / dL , potassium 3 . 52 meq / L Patient was diagnosed as severe malaria with jaundice and got quinine infusion in dextrose 5 % 500 mg / 8 hour .|On the second day the patient had vomitus , diarrhea , tinnitus , loss of hearing .|After 30 hours of quinine infusion the patient felt palpitation and electrocardiography ( ECG ) recording showed premature ventricular contraction ( PVC ) > 5 x / minute , trigemini , constant type - - sinoatrial block , positive U wave .|He was treated with lidocaine 50 mg intravenously followed by infusion 1500 mg in dextrose 5 % / 24 hour and potassium aspartate tablet .|Quinine infusion was discontinued and changed with sulfate quinine tablets .|Three hours later the patient felt better , the frequency of PVC reduced to 4 - 5 x / minute and on the third day ECG was normal , potassium level was 3 . 34 meq / L .|He was discharged on 7th day in good condition .|Quinine , like quinidine , is a chincona alkaloid that has anti - arrhythmic property , although it also pro - arrhythmic that can cause various arrhythmias , including severe arrhythmia such as multiple PVC .|Administration of parenteral quinine must be done carefully and with good observation because of its pro - arrhythmic effect , especially in older patients who have heart diseases or patients with electrolyte disorder ( hypokalemia ) which frequently occurs due to vomiting and or diarrhea in malaria cases

17346443	Penicillamine - related lichenoid dermatitis and utility of zinc acetate in a Wilson disease patient with hepatic presentation , anxiety and SPECT abnormalities .|Wilson 's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic copper metabolism with consequent copper accumulation and toxicity in many tissues and consequent hepatic , neurologic and psychiatric disorders .|We report a case of Wilson 's disease with chronic liver disease ; moreover , in our patient , presenting also with high levels of state anxiety without depression , 99mTc - ECD - SPECT showed cortical hypoperfusion in frontal lobes , more marked on the left frontal lobe .|During the follow - up of our patient , penicillamine was interrupted after the appearance of a lichenoid dermatitis , and zinc acetate permitted to continue the successful treatment of the patient without side - effects .|In our case the therapy with zinc acetate represented an effective treatment for a Wilson 's disease patient in which penicillamine - related side effects appeared .|The safety of the zinc acetate allowed us to avoid other potentially toxic chelating drugs ; this observation is in line with the growing evidence on the efficacy of the drug in the treatment of Wilson 's disease .|Since most of Wilson 's disease penicillamine - treated patients do not seem to develop this skin lesion , it could

924 white , 291 black , 23 Asian , 108 other ; mean age , 52 . 7 years ; mean weight , 92 . 6 kg ) .|All active treatments were associated with significantly reduced MSSBP and MSDBP during the core 8 - week study , with each monotherapy significantly contributing to the overall effect of combination therapy ( VAL and HCTZ , P < 0 . 001 ) .|Each combination was associated with significantly greater reductions in MSSBP and MSDBP compared with the monotherapies and placebo ( all , P < 0 . 001 ) .|The mean reduction in MSSBP / MSDBP with VAL / HCTZ 320 / 25 mg was 24 . 7 / 16 . 6 mm Hg , compared with 5 . 9 / 7 . 0 mm Hg with placebo .|The reduction in MSSBP was significantly greater with VAL / HCTZ 320 / 25 mg compared with VAL / HCTZ 160 / 12 . 5 mg ( P < 0 . 002 ) .|Rates of response and BP control were significantly higher in the groups that received combination treatment compared with those that received monotherapy .|The incidence of hypokalemia was lower with VAL / HCTZ combinations ( 1 . 8 % - 6 . 1 % ) than with HCTZ monotherapies ( 7 . 1 % - 13 . 3 % ) .|The majority of adverse events in the core study were of mild to moderate severity .|The efficacy and tolerability of VAL / HCTZ combinations were maintained during the extension ( 797 patients ) .|CONCLUSIONS : In this study population , combination therapies with VAL / HCTZ were associated with significantly greater BP reductions compared with either monotherapy , were well tolerated , and were associated with less hypokalemia than HCTZ alone .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	90-91	103-104	C081489	valsartan|valsartan|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL	Chemical	2:103:105:189:203:251:420:467:507:516:563:615:639	3:104:106:190:204:252:421:468:508:517:564:616:640	0:3:3:5:5:7:12:14:15:15:17:19:20	D006973	hypertensive|hypertension|hypertension|hypertensive	Disease	35:46:68:90	36:47:69:91	0:1:2:2	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	105-106	122-124	C081489	valsartan|valsartan|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL	Chemical	2:103:105:189:203:251:420:467:507:516:563:615:639	3:104:106:190:204:252:421:468:508:517:564:616:640	0:3:3:5:5:7:12:14:15:15:17:19:20	C562386	essential hypertension|essential hypertension	Disease	122:157	124:159	3:5	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	559-560	563-564	C081489	valsartan|valsartan|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL|VAL	Chemical	2:103:105:189:203:251:420:467:507:516:563:615:639	3:104:106:190:204:252:421:468:508:517:564:616:640	0:3:3:5:5:7:12:14:15:15:17:19:20	D007008	hypokalemia|hypokalemia	Disease	559:663	560:664	17:20	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	90-91	108-109	D006852	hydrochlorothiazide|hydrochlorothiazide|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ	Chemical	4:108:110:195:205:253:422:469:509:518:565:580:617:641:665	5:109:111:196:206:254:423:470:510:519:566:581:618:642:666	0:3:3:5:5:7:12:14:15:15:17:17:19:20:20	D006973	hypertensive|hypertension|hypertension|hypertensive	Disease	35:46:68:90	36:47:69:91	0:1:2:2	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	110-111	122-124	D006852	hydrochlorothiazide|hydrochlorothiazide|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ	Chemical	4:108:110:195:205:253:422:469:509:518:565:580:617:641:665	5:109:111:196:206:254:423:470:510:519:566:581:618:642:666	0:3:3:5:5:7:12:14:15:15:17:17:19:20:20	C562386	essential hypertension|essential hypertension	Disease	122:157	124:159	3:5	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	663-664	665-666	D006852	hydrochlorothiazide|hydrochlorothiazide|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ|HCTZ	Chemical	4:108:110:195:205:253:422:469:509:518:565:580:617:641:665	5:109:111:196:206:254:423:470:510:519:566:581:618:642:666	0:3:3:5:5:7:12:14:15:15:17:17:19:20:20	D007008	hypokalemia|hypokalemia	Disease	559:663	560:664	17:20
17384765	Succimer chelation improves learning , attention , and arousal regulation in lead - exposed rats but produces lasting cognitive impairment in the absence of lead exposure .|BACKGROUND : There is growing pressure for clinicians to prescribe chelation therapy at only slightly elevated blood lead levels .|However , very few studies have evaluated whether chelation improves cognitive outcomes in Pb - exposed children , or whether these agents have adverse effects that may affect brain development in the absence of Pb exposure .|OBJECTIVES : The present study was designed to answer these questions , using a rodent model of early childhood Pb exposure and treatment with succimer , a widely used chelating agent for the treatment of Pb poisoning .|RESULTS : Pb exposure produced lasting impairments in learning , attention , inhibitory control , and arousal regulation , paralleling the areas of dysfunction seen in Pb - exposed children .|Succimer treatment of the Pb - exposed rats significantly improved learning , attention , and arousal regulation , although the efficacy of the treatment varied as a function of the Pb exposure level and the specific functional deficit .|In contrast , succimer treatment of rats not previously exposed to Pb produced lasting and pervasive cognitive and affective dysfunction comparable in magnitude to that produced by the higher Pb exposure regimen .|CONCLUSIONS : These are the first data , to our knowledge , to show that treatment with any chelating agent can alleviate cognitive deficits due to Pb exposure .|These findings suggest that it may be possible to identify a succimer treatment protocol that improves cognitive outcomes in Pb - exposed children .|However , they also suggest that succimer treatment should be strongly discouraged for children who do not have elevated tissue levels of Pb or other heavy metals .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	195-196	208-212	D004113	Succimer|succimer|Succimer|succimer|succimer|succimer	Chemical	0:108:153:195:265:284	1:109:154:196:266:285	0:3:5:6:8:9	D003072	cognitive impairment|cognitive and affective dysfunction|cognitive deficits	Disease	18:208:247	20:212:249	0:6:7	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	108-109	119-121	D004113	Succimer|succimer|Succimer|succimer|succimer|succimer	Chemical	0:108:153:195:265:284	1:109:154:196:266:285	0:3:5:6:8:9	D007855	Pb poisoning	Disease	119	121	3	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	128-140	153-154	D004113	Succimer|succimer|Succimer|succimer|succimer|succimer	Chemical	0:108:153:195:265:284	1:109:154:196:266:285	0:3:5:6:8:9	D007859	impairments in learning , attention , inhibitory control , and arousal regulation	Disease	128	140	4	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	128-140	153-154	D004113	Succimer|succimer|Succimer|succimer|succimer|succimer	Chemical	0:108:153:195:265:284	1:109:154:196:266:285	0:3:5:6:8:9	D019958	impairments in learning , attention , inhibitory control , and arousal regulation	Disease	128	140	4	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	195-196	208-212	D004113	Succimer|succimer|Succimer|succimer|succimer|succimer	Chemical	0:108:153:195:265:284	1:109:154:196:266:285	0:3:5:6:8:9	D019964	cognitive and affective dysfunction	Disease	208	212	6	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	247-249	251-252	D007854	lead|lead|lead|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb	Chemical	11:24:44:60:81:103:124:148:157:183:203:221:251:273:300	12:25:45:61:82:104:125:149:158:184:204:222:252:274:301	0:0:1:2:2:3:4:4:5:5:6:6:7:8:9	D003072	cognitive impairment|cognitive and affective dysfunction|cognitive deficits	Disease	18:208:247	20:212:249	0:6:7	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	119-121	124-125	D007854	lead|lead|lead|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb	Chemical	11:24:44:60:81:103:124:148:157:183:203:221:251:273:300	12:25:45:61:82:104:125:149:158:184:204:222:252:274:301	0:0:1:2:2:3:4:4:5:5:6:6:7:8:9	D007855	Pb poisoning	Disease	119	121	3	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	124-125	128-140	D007854	lead|lead|lead|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb	Chemical	11:24:44:60:81:103:124:148:157:183:203:221:251:273:300	12:25:45:61:82:104:125:149:158:184:204:222:252:274:301	0:0:1:2:2:3:4:4:5:5:6:6:7:8:9	D007859	impairments in learning , attention , inhibitory control , and arousal regulation	Disease	128	140	4	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	124-125	128-140	D007854	lead|lead|lead|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb	Chemical	11:24:44:60:81:103:124:148:157:183:203:221:251:273:300	12:25:45:61:82:104:125:149:158:184:204:222:252:274:301	0:0:1:2:2:3:4:4:5:5:6:6:7:8:9	D019958	impairments in learning , attention , inhibitory control , and arousal regulation	Disease	128	140	4	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	203-204	208-212	D007854	lead|lead|lead|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb|Pb	Chemical	11:24:44:60:81:103:124:148:157:183:203:221:251:273:300	12:25:45:61:82:104:125:149:158:184:204:222:252:274:301	0:0:1:2:2:3:4:4:5:5:6:6:7:8:9	D019964	cognitive and affective dysfunction	Disease	208	212	6

17543491	Frequency of transient ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia .|BACKGROUND : Especially because of improvements in clinical neurologic monitoring , carotid endarterectomy done under local anesthesia has become the technique of choice in several centers .|Temporary ipsilateral vocal nerve palsies due to local anesthetics have been described , however .|Such complications are most important in situations where there is a pre - existing contralateral paralysis .|We therefore examined the effect of local anesthesia on vocal cord function to better understand its possible consequences .|METHODS : This prospective study included 28 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia .|Vocal cord function was evaluated before , during , and after surgery ( postoperative day 1 ) using flexible laryngoscopy .|Anesthesia was performed by injecting 20 to 40 mL of a mixture of long - acting ( ropivacaine ) and short - acting ( prilocaine ) anesthetic .|RESULTS : All patients had normal vocal cord function preoperatively .|Twelve patients ( 43 % ) were found to have intraoperative ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis .|It resolved in all cases < or = 24 hours .|There were no significant differences in operating time or volume or frequency of anesthetic administration in patients with temporary vocal cord paralysis compared with those without .|CONCLUSION : Local anesthesia led to temporary ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in almost half of these patients .|Because pre - existing paralysis is of a relevant frequency ( up to 3 % ) , a preoperative evaluation of vocal cord function before carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia is recommended to avoid intraoperative bilateral paralysis .|In patients with preoperative contralateral vocal cord paralysis , surgery under general anesthesia should be considered .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	181-184	147-148	C037663	ropivacaine	Chemical	147	148	7	D014826	vocal cord paralysis|vocal nerve palsies|vocal cord paralysis|vocal cord paralysis|vocal cord paralysis|vocal cord paralysis	Disease	4:45:181:215:231:284	7:48:184:218:234:287	0:2:9:11:12:14	1:CID:2	R2L	CROSS	181-184	154-155	D011318	prilocaine	Chemical	154	155	7	D014826	vocal cord paralysis|vocal nerve palsies|vocal cord paralysis|vocal cord paralysis|vocal cord paralysis|vocal cord paralysis	Disease	4:45:181:215:231:284	7:48:184:218:234:287	0:2:9:11:12:14	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	147-148	73-74	C037663	ropivacaine	Chemical	147	148	7	D010243	paralysis|paralysis|paralysis	Disease	73:245:277	74:246:278	3:13:13	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	154-155	73-74	D011318	prilocaine	Chemical	154	155	7	D010243	paralysis|paralysis|paralysis	Disease	73:245:277	74:246:278	3:13:13

18165598	The differential effects of bupivacaine and lidocaine on prostaglandin E2 release , cyclooxygenase gene expression and pain in a clinical pain model .|BACKGROUND : In addition to blocking nociceptive input from surgical sites , long - acting local anesthetics might directly modulate inflammation .|In the present study , we describe the proinflammatory effects of bupivacaine on local prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) production and cyclooxygenase ( COX ) gene expression that increases postoperative pain in human subjects .|METHODS : Subjects ( n = 114 ) undergoing extraction of impacted third molars received either 2 % lidocaine or 0 . 5 % bupivacaine before surgery and either rofecoxib 50 mg or placebo orally 90 min before surgery and for the following 48 h .|Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 h after surgery .|After extraction , a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for PGE2 and thromboxane B2 ( TXB2 ) measurements .|RESULTS : The bupivacaine / rofecoxib group reported significantly less pain , as assessed by a visual analog scale , compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h .|However , the bupivacaine / placebo group reported significantly more pain at 24 h and PGE2 levels during the first 4 h were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups .|Moreover , bupivacaine significantly increased COX -

18450790	Thalidomide and sensory neurotoxicity : a neurophysiological study .|BACKGROUND : Recent studies confirmed a high incidence of sensory axonal neuropathy in patients treated with different doses of thalidomide .|The study 's aims were to measure variations in sural nerve sensory action potential ( SAP ) amplitude in patients with refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosus ( CLE ) treated with thalidomide and use these findings to identify the neurotoxic potential of thalidomide and the recovery capacity of sensory fibres after discontinuation of treatment .|PATIENTS AND METHODS : Clinical and electrophysiological data in 12 female patients with CLE during treatment with thalidomide and up to 47 months after discontinuation of treatment were analysed .|Sural nerve SAP amplitude reduction > or = 40 % was the criteria for discontinuing therapy .|RESULTS : During treatment , 11 patients showed a reduction in sural nerve SAP amplitude compared to baseline values ( 9 with a reduction > or = 50 % and 2 < 50 % ) .|One patient showed no changes in SAP amplitude .|Five patients complained of paresthesias and leg cramps .|After thalidomide treatment , sural SAP amplitude recovered in 3 patients .|At detection of reduction in sural nerve SAP amplitude , the median thalidomide cumulative dose was 21 . 4 g .|The threshold neurotoxic dosage is lower than previously reported .|CONCLUSIONS : Sural nerve SAP amplitude reduction is a reliable and sensitive marker of degeneration and recovery of sensory fibres .|This electrophysiological parameter provides information about subclinical neurotoxic potential of thalidomide but is not helpful in predicting the appearance of sensory symptoms .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	0-1	2-4	D013792	Thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide	Chemical	0:28:60:71:101:186:209:259	1:29:61:72:102:187:210:260	0:1:2:2:3:8:9:12	D010523	sensory neurotoxicity|sensory axonal neuropathy	Disease	2:18	4:21	0:1	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	56-57	60-61	D013792	Thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide	Chemical	0:28:60:71:101:186:209:259	1:29:61:72:102:187:210:260	0:1:2:2:3:8:9:12	D008178	cutaneous lupus erythematosus|CLE|CLE	Disease	52:56:97	55:57:98	2:2:3	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	68-69	71-72	D013792	Thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide	Chemical	0:28:60:71:101:186:209:259	1:29:61:72:102:187:210:260	0:1:2:2:3:8:9:12	D020258	neurotoxic|neurotoxic|neurotoxic	Disease	68:220:256	69:221:257	2:10:12	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	180-181	186-187	D013792	Thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide	Chemical	0:28:60:71:101:186:209:259	1:29:61:72:102:187:210:260	0:1:2:2:3:8:9:12	D010292	paresthesias	Disease	180	181	7	1:CID:2	L2R	CROSS	183-184	186-187	D013792	Thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide|thalidomide	Chemical	0:28:60:71:101:186:209:259	1:29:61:72:102:187:210:260	0:1:2:2:3:8:9:12	D009120	cramps	Disease	183	184	7

19293073	Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events : an update of the evidence for the U . S .|Preventive Services Task Force .|BACKGROUND : Coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are leading causes of death in the United States .|In 2002 , the U . S .|Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) strongly recommended that clinicians discuss aspirin with adults who are at increased risk for coronary heart disease .|PURPOSE : To determine the benefits and harms of taking aspirin for the primary prevention of myocardial infarctions , strokes , and death .|DATA SOURCES : MEDLINE and Cochrane Library ( search dates , 1 January 2001 to 28 August 2008 ) , recent systematic reviews , reference lists of retrieved articles , and suggestions from experts .|STUDY SELECTION : English - language randomized , controlled trials ( RCTs ) ; case - control studies ; meta - analyses ; and systematic reviews of aspirin versus control for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) were selected to answer the following questions : Does aspirin decrease coronary heart events , strokes , death from coronary heart events or stroke , or all - cause mortality in adults without known CVD ? Does aspirin increase gastrointestinal bleeding or hemorrhagic strokes ? DATA EXTRACTION : All studies were reviewed , abstracted , and rated for quality by using predefined USPSTF criteria .|DATA SYNTHESIS : New evidence from 1 good - quality RCT , 1 good - quality meta - analysis , and 2 fair - quality subanalyses of RCTs demonstrates that aspirin use reduces the number of CVD events in patients without known CVD .|Men in these studies experienced fewer myocardial infarctions and women experienced fewer ischemic strokes .|Aspirin does not seem to affect CVD mortality or all - cause mortality in either men or women .|The use of aspirin for primary prevention increases the risk for major bleeding events , primarily gastrointestinal bleeding events , in both men and women .|Men have an increased risk for hemorrhagic strokes with aspirin use .|A new RCT and meta - analysis suggest that the risk for hemorrhagic strokes in women is not statistically significantly increased .|LIMITATIONS : New evidence on aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD is limited .|The dose of aspirin used in the RCTs varied , which prevented the estimation of the most appropriate dose for primary prevention .|Several of the RCTs were conducted within populations of health professionals , which potentially limits generalizability .|CONCLUSION : Aspirin reduces the risk for myocardial infarction in men and strokes in women .|Aspirin use increases the risk for serious bleeding events .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	63-64	72-75	D001241	Aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|Aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|Aspirin|Aspirin	Chemical	0:63:86:162:184:212:270:299:321:353:383:396:435:449	1:64:87:163:185:213:271:300:322:354:384:397:436:450	0:4:5:7:7:7:8:10:11:12:14:15:17:18	D003327	Coronary heart disease|coronary heart disease	Disease	27:72	30:75	2:4	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	0-1	31-33	D001241	Aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|Aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|Aspirin|Aspirin	Chemical	0:63:86:162:184:212:270:299:321:353:383:396:435:449	1:64:87:163:185:213:271:300:322:354:384:397:436:450	0:4:5:7:7:7:8:10:11:12:14:15:17:18	D002561	cerebrovascular disease	Disease	31	33	2	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	435-436	440-442	D001241	Aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|Aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|Aspirin|Aspirin	Chemical	0:63:86:162:184:212:270:299:321:353:383:396:435:449	1:64:87:163:185:213:271:300:322:354:384:397:436:450	0:4:5:7:7:7:8:10:11:12:14:15:17:18	D009203	myocardial infarctions|myocardial infarctions|myocardial infarction	Disease	92:290:440	94:292:442	5:9:17	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	297-298	299-300	D001241	Aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|Aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|Aspirin|Aspirin	Chemical	0:63:86:162:184:212:270:299:321:353:383:396:435:449	1:64:87:163:185:213:271:300:322:354:384:397:436:450	0:4:5:7:7:7:8:10:11:12:14:15:17:18	D020521	strokes|strokes|stroke|hemorrhagic strokes|strokes|hemorrhagic strokes|hemorrhagic strokes|strokes	Disease	95:190:198:217:297:350:368:445	96:191:199:219:298:352:370:446	5:7:7:7:9:12:13:17	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	209-210	212-213	D001241	Aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|Aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|Aspirin|Aspirin	Chemical	0:63:86:162:184:212:270:299:321:353:383:396:435:449	1:64:87:163:185:213:271:300:322:354:384:397:436:450	0:4:5:7:7:7:8:10:11:12:14:15:17:18	D002318	cardiovascular disease|CVD|CVD|CVD|CVD|CVD|CVD	Disease	170:173:209:276:282:305:389	172:174:210:277:283:306:390	7:7:7:8:8:10:14	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	212-213	214-216	D001241	Aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|Aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|Aspirin|Aspirin	Chemical	0:63:86:162:184:212:270:299:321:353:383:396:435:449	1:64:87:163:185:213:271:300:322:354:384:397:436:450	0:4:5:7:7:7:8:10:11:12:14:15:17:18	D006471	gastrointestinal bleeding|gastrointestinal bleeding	Disease	214:334	216:336	7:11	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	350-352	353-354	D001241	Aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|Aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|Aspirin|Aspirin	Chemical	0:63:86:162:184:212:270:299:321:353:383:396:435:449	1:64:87:163:185:213:271:300:322:354:384:397:436:450	0:4:5:7:7:7:8:10:11:12:14:15:17:18	D020300	hemorrhagic strokes|hemorrhagic strokes|hemorrhagic strokes	Disease	217:350:368	219:352:370	7:12:13	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	449-450	456-457	D001241	Aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|Aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|aspirin|Aspirin|Aspirin	Chemical	0:63:86:162:184:212:270:299:321:353:383:396:435:449	1:64:87:163:185:213:271:300:322:354:384:397:436:450	0:4:5:7:7:7:8:10:11:12:14:15:17:18	D006470	bleeding|bleeding	Disease	330:456	331:457	11:18
19338378	Reducing harm associated with anticoagulation : practical considerations of argatroban therapy in heparin - induced thrombocytopenia .|Argatroban is a hepatically metabolized , direct thrombin inhibitor used for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) and for patients with or at risk of HIT undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .|The objective of this review is to summarize practical considerations of argatroban therapy in HIT .|The US FDA - recommended argatroban dose in HIT is 2 microg / kg / min ( reduced in patients with hepatic impairment and in paediatric patients ) , adjusted to achieve activated partial thromboplastin times ( aPTTs ) 1 . 5 - 3 times baseline ( not > 100 seconds ) .|Contemporary experiences indicate that reduced doses are also needed in patients with conditions associated with hepatic hypoperfusion , e . g .|heart failure , yet are unnecessary for renal dysfunction , adult age , sex , race / ethnicity or obesity .|Argatroban 0 . 5 - 1 . 2 microg / kg / min typically supports therapeutic aPTTs .|The FDA - recommended dose during PCI is 25 microg / kg / min ( 350 microg / kg initial bolus ) , adjusted to achieve activated clotting times ( ACTs ) of 300 - 450 sec .|For PCI , argatroban has not been investigated in hepatically impaired patients ; dose adjustment is unnecessary for adult age , sex , race / ethnicity or obesity , and lesser doses may be adequate with concurrent glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibition .|Argatroban prolongs the International Normalized Ratio , and published approaches for monitoring the argatroban - to - warfarin transition should be followed .|Major bleeding with argatroban is 0 - 10 % in the non - interventional setting and 0 - 5 . 8 % periprocedurally .|Argatroban has no specific antidote , and if excessive anticoagulation occurs , argatroban infusion should be stopped or reduced .|Improved familiarity of healthcare professionals with argatroban therapy in HIT , including in special populations and during PCI , may facilitate reduction of harm associated with HIT ( e . g . fewer thromboses ) or its treatment ( e . g . fewer argatroban medication errors )

19531695	Delirium in a patient with toxic flecainide plasma concentrations : the role of a pharmacokinetic drug interaction with paroxetine .|OBJECTIVE : To describe a case of flecainide - induced delirium associated with a pharmacokinetic drug interaction with paroxetine .|CASE SUMMARY : A 69 - year - old white female presented to the emergency department with a history of confusion and paranoia over the past several days .|On admission the patient was taking carvedilol 12 mg twice daily , warfarin 2 mg / day , folic acid 1 mg / day , levothyroxine 100 microg / day , pantoprazole 40 mg / day , paroxetine 40 mg / day , and flecainide 100 mg twice daily .|Flecainide had been started 2 weeks prior for atrial fibrillation .|Laboratory test findings on admission were notable only for a flecainide plasma concentration of 1360 microg / L ( reference range 200 - 1000 ) .|A metabolic drug interaction between flecainide and paroxetine , which the patient had been taking for more than 5 years , was considered .|Paroxetine was discontinued and the dose of flecainide was reduced to 50 mg twice daily .|Her delirium resolved 3 days later .|DISCUSSION : Flecainide and pharmacologically similar agents that interact with sodium channels may cause delirium in susceptible patients .|A MEDLINE search ( 1966 - January 2009 ) revealed one in vivo pharmacokinetic study on the interaction between flecainide , a CYP2D6 substrate , and paroxetine , a CYP2D6 inhibitor , as well as 3 case reports of flecainide - induced delirium .|According to the Naranjo probability scale , flecainide was the probable cause of the patient 's delirium ; the Horn Drug Interaction Probability Scale indicates a possible pharmacokinetic drug interaction between flecainide and paroxetine .|CONCLUSIONS :

19549709	Efficacy of everolimus ( RAD001 ) in patients with advanced NSCLC previously treated with chemotherapy alone or with chemotherapy and EGFR inhibitors .|BACKGROUND : Treatment options are scarce in pretreated advanced non - small - cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients .|RAD001 , an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) , has shown phase I efficacy in NSCLC .|METHODS : Stage IIIb or IV NSCLC patients , with two or fewer prior chemotherapy regimens , one platinum based ( stratum 1 ) or both chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( stratum 2 ) , received RAD001 10 mg / day until progression or unacceptable toxicity .|Primary objective was overall response rate ( ORR ) .|Analyses of markers associated with the mTOR pathway were carried out on archival tumor from a subgroup using immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) and direct mutation sequencing .|RESULTS : Eighty - five patients were enrolled , 42 in stratum 1 and 43 in stratum .|ORR was 4 . 7 % ( 7 . 1 % stratum 1 ; 2 . 3 % stratum 2 ) .|Overall disease control rate was 47 . 1 % .|Median progression - free survivals ( PFSs ) were 2 . 6 ( stratum 1 ) and 2 . 7 months ( stratum 2 ) .|Common > or = grade 3 events were fatigue , dyspnea , stomatitis , anemia , and thrombocytopenia .|Pneumonitis , probably or possibly related , mainly grade 1 / 2 , occurred in 25 % .|Cox regression analysis of IHC scores found that only phospho AKT ( pAKT ) was a significant independent predictor of worse PFS .|CONCLUSIONS : RAD001 10 mg / day was well tolerated , showing modest clinical activity in pretreated NSCLC .|Evaluation of RAD001 plus standard therapy for metastatic NSCLC continues .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	40-41	44-45	C107135	everolimus|RAD001|RAD001|RAD001|RAD001|RAD001	Chemical	2:4:44:108:294:313	3:5:45:109:295:314	0:0:2:3:13:14	D002289	NSCLC|non -

alpha ( TNFalpha ) , hippocampal MT and malondialdehyde ( MDA ) contents as well as caspase - 3 activity in addition to histological alterations .|ZnSO ( 4 ) pretreatment counteracted BCNU - induced inhibition of GR and depletion of GSH and resulted in significant reduction in the levels of MDA and TNFalpha as well as the activity of caspase - 3 .|The histological features were improved in hippocampus of rats treated with ZnSO ( 4 ) + BCNU compared to only BCNU - treated animals .|In conclusion , MT induction halts BCNU - induced hippocampal toxicity as it prevented GR inhibition and GSH depletion and counteracted the increased levels of TNFalpha , MDA and caspase - 3 activity with subsequent preservation of cognition .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	67-68	77-79	D008668	Metallothionein|metallothionein|MT|MT|MT|MT	Chemical	0:40:42:67:312:398	1:41:43:68:313:399	0:2:2:3:9:12	D003072	cognitive dysfunction	Disease	77	79	3	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	257-265	312-313	D008668	Metallothionein|metallothionein|MT|MT|MT|MT	Chemical	0:40:42:67:312:398	1:41:43:68:313:399	0:2:2:3:9:12	D007859	deterioration of learning and short -

20169779	Neuropsychiatric behaviors in the MPTP marmoset model of Parkinson 's disease .|OBJECTIVES : Neuropsychiatric symptoms are increasingly recognised as a significant problem in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) .|These symptoms may be due to ' sensitisation ' following repeated levodopa treatment or a direct effect of dopamine on the disease state .|The levodopa - treated MPTP - lesioned marmoset was used as a model of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD patients .|Here we compare the time course of levodopa - induced motor fluctuations and neuropsychiatric - like behaviors to determine the relationship between duration of treatment and onset of symptoms .|METHODS : Marmosets were administered 1 - methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 - tetrahydropyridine ( 2 . 0 mg / kg s . c . ) for five days , resulting in stable parkinsonism .|Levodopa ( 15 mg / kg and benserazide , 3 . 75 mg / kg ) p . o .|b . i . d , was administered for 30 days .|Animals were evaluated for parkinsonian disability , dyskinesia and on - time ( motor fluctuations ) and neuropsychiatric - like behaviors on Day 0 ( prior to levodopa ) and on Days 1 , 7 , 13 , 27 and 30 of treatment using post hoc DVD analysis by a trained rater , blind to the treatment day .|RESULTS : The neuropsychiatric - like behavior rating scale demonstrated high interrater reliability between three trained raters of differing professional backgrounds .|As anticipated , animals exhibited a progressive increase in levodopa - induced motor fluctuations , dyskinesia and wearing - off , that correlated with the duration of levodopa therapy .|In contrast , levodopa - induced neuropsychiatric - like behaviors were present on Day 1 of levodopa treatment and their severity did not correlate with duration of treatment .|CONCLUSIONS : The data suggest that neuropsychiatric disorders in PD are more likely an interaction between levodopa and the disease state than a consequence of sensitisation to repeated dopaminergic therapy .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	4-5	8-11	D015632	MPTP|MPTP|1 -

20192893	Contrast medium nephrotoxicity after renal artery and coronary angioplasty .|BACKGROUND : Renal dysfunction induced by iodinated contrast medium ( CM ) administration can minimize the benefit of the interventional procedure in patients undergoing renal angioplasty ( PTRA ) .|PURPOSE : To compare the susceptibility to nephrotoxic effect of CM in patients undergoing PTRA with that of patients submitted to percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .|MATERIAL AND METHODS : A total of 33 patients successfully treated with PTRA ( PTRA group , mean age 70 + / - 12 years , 23 female , basal creatinine 1 . 46 + / - 0 . 79 , range 0 . 7 - 4 . 9 mg / dl ) were compared with 33 patients undergoing successful PCI ( PCI group ) , matched for basal creatinine ( 1 . 44 + / - 0 . 6 , range 0 . 7 - 3 . 4 mg / dl ) , gender , and age .|In both groups postprocedural ( 48 h ) serum creatinine was measured .|RESULTS : Postprocedural creatinine level decreased nonsignificantly in the PTRA group ( 1 . 46 + / - 0 . 8 vs . 1 . 34 + / - 0 . 5 mg / dl , P = NS ) and increased significantly in the PCI group ( 1 . 44 + / - 0 . 6 vs . 1 . 57 + / - 0 . 7 mg / dl , P < 0 . 02 ) .|Changes in serum creatinine after intervention ( after - before ) were significantly different between the PTRA and PCI groups ( - 0 . 12 + / - 0 . 5 vs . 0 . 13 + / - 0 . 3 , P = 0 . 014 ) .|This difference was not related to either a different clinical risk profile or to the volume of CM administered .|CONCLUSION : In this preliminary study patients submitted to PTRA showed a lower susceptibility to renal damage induced by CM administration than PCI patients .|The effectiveness of PTRA on renal function seems to be barely influenced by CM toxicity .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	0-2	2-3	D003287	Contrast medium|contrast medium|CM|CM|CM|CM|CM	Chemical	0:17:20:50:326:348:367	2:19:21:51:327:349:368	0:1:1:2:7:8:9	D007674	nephrotoxicity|Renal dysfunction|nephrotoxic|renal damage	Disease	2:12:47:344	3:14:48:346	0:1:2:8	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	367-368	368-369	D003287	Contrast medium|contrast medium|CM|CM|CM|CM|CM	Chemical	0:17:20:50:326:348:367	2:19:21:51:327:349:368	0:1:1:2:7:8:9	D064420	toxicity	Disease	368	369	9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	98-99	47-48	D003404	creatinine|creatinine|creatinine|creatinine|creatinine	Chemical	98:137:176:183:262	99:138:177:184:263	3:3:4:5:6	D007674	nephrotoxicity|Renal dysfunction|nephrotoxic|renal damage	Disease	2:12:47:344	3:14:48:346	0:1:2:8	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	262-263	368-369	D003404	creatinine|creatinine|creatinine|creatinine|creatinine	Chemical	98:137:176:183:262	99:138:177:184:263	3:3:4:5:6	D064420	toxicity	Disease	368	369	9
20408947	Medical and psychiatric outcomes for patients transplanted for acetaminophen - induced acute liver failure : a case - control study .|BACKGROUND : Acetaminophen - induced hepatotoxicity is the most common cause of acute liver failure ( ALF ) in the UK .|Patients often consume the drug with suicidal intent or with a background of substance dependence .|AIMS AND METHODS : We compared the severity of pretransplant illness , psychiatric co - morbidity , medical and psychosocial outcomes of all patients who had undergone liver transplantation ( LT ) emergently between 1999 - 2004 for acetaminophen - induced ALF ( n = 36 ) with age - and sex - matched patients undergoing emergent LT for non - acetaminophen - induced ALF ( n = 35 ) and elective LT for chronic liver disease ( CLD , n = 34 ) .|RESULTS : Acetaminophen - induced ALF patients undergoing LT had a greater severity of pre - LT illness reflected by higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores and requirement for organ support compared with the other two groups .|Twenty ( 56 % ) acetaminophen - induced ALF patients had a formal psychiatric diagnosis before LT ( non - acetaminophen - induced ALF = 0 / 35 , CLD = 2 / 34 ; P < 0 . 01 for all ) and nine ( 25 % ) had a previous suicide attempt .|During follow - up ( median 5 years ) , there were no significant differences in rejection ( acute and chronic ) , graft failure or survival between the groups ( acetaminophen - induced ALF 1 year 87 % , 5 years 75 % ; non - acetaminophen - induced ALF 88 % , 78 % ; CLD 93 % , 82 % : P > 0 . 6 log rank ) .|Two acetaminophen - induced ALF patients reattempted suicide post - LT ( one died 8 years post - LT ) .|CONCLUSIONS : Despite a high prevalence of psychiatric disturbance , outcomes for patients transplanted emergently for acetaminophen - induced ALF were comparable to those transplanted for non - acetaminophen - induced ALF and electively for CLD .|Multidisciplinary approaches with long - term psychiatric follow - up may contribute to low post - transplant suicide rates seen and low rates of graft loss because of non - compliance .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	8-9	11-14	D000082	acetaminophen|Acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen|Acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen	Chemical	8:23:97:120:146:190:205:271:287:314:350:362	9:24:98:121:147:191:206:272:288:315:351:363	0:1:3:3:4:5:5:6:6:7:8:8	D017114	acute liver failure|acute liver failure|ALF|ALF|ALF|ALF|ALF|ALF|ALF|ALF|ALF|ALF|ALF	Disease	11:33:37:100:123:149:193:208:274:290:317:353:365	14:36:38:101:124:150:194:209:275:291:318:354:366	0:1:1:3:3:4:5:5:6:6:7:8:8	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	23-24	26-27	D000082	acetaminophen|Acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen|Acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen	Chemical	8:23:97:120:146:190:205:271:287:314:350:362	9:24:98:121:147:191:206:272:288:315:351:363	0:1:3:3:4:5:5:6:6:7:8:8	D056486	hepatotoxicity	Disease	26	27	1	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	362-363	369-370	D000082	acetaminophen|Acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen|Acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen|acetaminophen	Chemical	8:23:97:120:146:190:205:271:287:314:350:362	9:24:98:121:147:191:206:272:288:315:351:363	0:1:3:3:4:5:5:6:6:7:8:8	D008107	chronic liver disease|CLD|CLD|CLD|CLD	Disease	133:137:214:297:369	136:138:215:298:370	3:3:5:6:8
20447294	Studies of synergy between morphine and a novel sodium channel blocker , CNSB002 , in rat models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain .|OBJECTIVE : This study determined the antihyperalgesic effect of CNSB002 , a sodium channel blocker with antioxidant properties given alone and in combinations with morphine in rat models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain .|DESIGN : Dose response curves for nonsedating doses of morphine and CNSB002 given intraperitoneally alone and together in combinations were constructed for antihyperalgesic effect using paw withdrawal from noxious heat in two rat pain models : carrageenan - induced paw inflammation and streptozotocin ( STZ ) - induced diabetic neuropathy .|RESULTS : The maximum nonsedating doses were : morphine , 3 . 2 mg / kg ; CNSB002 10 . 0 mg / kg ; 5 . 0 mg / kg CNSB002 with morphine 3 . 2 mg / kg in combination .|The doses calculated to cause 50 % reversal of hyperalgesia ( ED50 ) were 7 . 54 ( 1 . 81 ) and 4 . 83 ( 1 . 54 ) in the carrageenan model and 44 . 18 ( 1 . 37 ) and 9 . 14 ( 1 . 24 ) in the STZ - induced neuropathy model for CNSB002 and morphine , respectively ( mg / kg ; mean , SEM ) .|These values were greater than the maximum nonsedating doses .|The ED50 values for morphine when given in combination with CNSB002 ( 5 mg / kg ) were less than the maximum nonsedating dose : 0 . 56 ( 1 . 55 ) in the carrageenan model and 1 . 37 ( 1 . 23 ) in the neuropathy model ( mg / kg ; mean , SEM ) .|The antinociception after morphine ( 3 . 2 mg / kg ) was increased by co - administration with CNSB002 from 28 . 0 and 31 . 7 % to 114 . 6 and 56 . 9 % reversal of hyperalgesia in the inflammatory and neuropathic models , respectively ( P < 0 . 01 ; one - way analysis of variance - significantly greater than either drug given alone ) .|CONCLUSIONS : The maximum antihyperalgesic effect achievable with nonsedating doses of morphine may be increased significantly when the drug is used in combination with CNSB002

20828385	Cytostatic and anti - angiogenic effects of temsirolimus in refractory mantle cell lymphoma .|Mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) is a rare and aggressive type of B - cell non - Hodgkin 's lymphoma .|Patients become progressively refractory to conventional chemotherapy , and their prognosis is poor .|However , a 38 % remission rate has been recently reported in refractory MCL treated with temsirolimus , a mTOR inhibitor . Here we had the opportunity to study a case of refractory MCL who had tumor regression two months after temsirolimus treatment , and a progression - free survival of 10 months .|In this case , lymph node biopsies were performed before and six months after temsirolimus therapy .|Comparison of the two biopsies showed that temsirolimus inhibited tumor cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest , but did not induce any change in the number of apoptotic tumor cells .|Apart from this cytostatic effect , temsirolimus had an antiangiogenic effect with decrease of tumor microvessel density and of VEGF expression .|Moreover , numerous patchy , well - limited fibrotic areas , compatible with post - necrotic tissue repair , were found after 6 - month temsirolimus therapy .|Thus , temsirolimus reduced tumor burden through associated cytostatic and anti - angiogenic effects . This dual effect of temsirolimus on tumor tissue could contribute to its recently reported efficiency in refractory MCL resistant to conventional chemotherapy .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	7-8	10-13	C401859	temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus	Chemical	7:66:91:118:128:158:199:204:221	8:67:92:119:129:159:200:205:222	0:3:3:4:5:6:7:8:8	D020522	mantle cell lymphoma|Mantle cell lymphoma|MCL|MCL|MCL|MCL	Disease	10:14:18:63:83:234	13:17:19:64:84:235	0:1:1:3:3:8	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	7-8	27-35	C401859	temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus	Chemical	7:66:91:118:128:158:199:204:221	8:67:92:119:129:159:200:205:222	0:3:3:4:5:6:7:8:8	D008228	B - cell non - Hodgkin 's lymphoma	Disease	27	35	1	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	128-129	130-131	C401859	temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus	Chemical	7:66:91:118:128:158:199:204:221	8:67:92:119:129:159:200:205:222	0:3:3:4:5:6:7:8:8	D009369	tumor|tumor|tumor|tumor|tumor|tumor	Disease	86:130:149:166:206:223	87:131:150:167:207:224	3:5:5:6:8:8	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	189-190	199-200	C401859	temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus|temsirolimus	Chemical	7:66:91:118:128:158:199:204:221	8:67:92:119:129:159:200:205:222	0:3:3:4:5:6:7:8:8	D009336	necrotic	Disease	189	190	7

20959502	Cerebrospinal fluid penetration of high - dose daptomycin in suspected Staphylococcus aureus meningitis .|OBJECTIVE : To report a case of methicillin - sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( MSSA ) bacteremia with suspected MSSA meningitis treated with high - dose daptomycin assessed with concurrent serum and cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) concentrations .|CASE SUMMARY : A 54 - year - old male presented to the emergency department with generalized weakness and presumed health - care - associated pneumonia shown on chest radiograph .|Treatment was empirically initiated with vancomycin , levofloxacin , and piperacillin / tazobactam .|Blood cultures revealed S . aureus susceptible to oxacillin .|Empiric antibiotic treatment was narrowed to nafcillin on day 4 .|On day 8 , the patient developed acute renal failure ( serum creatinine 1 . 9 mg / dL , increased from 1 . 2 mg / dL the previous day and 0 . 8 mg / dL on admission ) .|The patient 's Glasgow Coma Score was 3 , with normal findings shown on computed tomography scan of the head 72 hours following an episode of cardiac arrest on day 10 .|The patient experienced relapsing MSSA bacteremia on day 9 , increasing the suspicion for a central nervous system ( CNS ) infection .|Nafcillin was discontinued and daptomycin 9 mg / kg daily was initiated for suspected meningitis and was continued until the patient 's death on day 16 .|Daptomycin serum and CSF trough concentrations were 11 . 21 ug / mL and 0 . 52 ug / mL , respectively , prior to the third dose .|Lumbar puncture results were inconclusive and no further blood cultures were positive for MSSA .|Creatine kinase levels were normal prior to daptomycin therapy and were not reassessed .|DISCUSSION : Daptomycin was initiated in our patient secondary to possible nafcillin - induced acute interstitial nephritis and relapsing bacteremia .|At a dose of 9 mg / kg , resultant penetration of 5 % was higher than in previous reports , more consistent with inflamed meninges .|CONCLUSIONS : High - dose daptomycin may be an alternative option for MSSA bacteremia with or without a CNS source in patients who have failed or can not tolerate standard therapy .|Further clinical evaluation in patients with confirmed meningitis is warranted

24055495	Long - term oral galactose treatment prevents cognitive deficits in male Wistar rats treated intracerebroventricularly with streptozotocin .|Basic and clinical research has demonstrated that dementia of sporadic Alzheimer 's disease ( sAD ) type is associated with dysfunction of the insulin -

4 - epimer of d - glucose ) which is transported into the brain by insulin - independent GLUT3 transporter where it might be metabolized to glucose via the Leloir pathway .|Exclusively parenteral daily injections of galactose induce memory deterioration in rodents and are used to generate animal aging model , but the effects of oral galactose treatment on cognitive functions have never been tested .|We have investigated the effects of continuous daily oral galactose ( 200 mg / kg / day ) treatment on cognitive deficits in streptozotocin - induced ( STZ - icv ) rat model of sAD , tested by Morris Water Maze and Passive Avoidance test , respectively .|One month of oral galactose treatment initiated immediately after the STZ - icv administration , successfully prevented development of the STZ - icv - induced cognitive deficits .|Beneficial effect of oral galactose was independent of the rat age and of the galactose dose ranging from 100 to 300 mg / kg / day .|Additionally , oral galactose administration led to the appearance of galactose in the blood .|The increase of galactose concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid was several times lower after oral than after parenteral administration of the same galactose dose .|Oral galactose exposure might have beneficial effects on learning and memory ability and could be worth investigating for improvement of cognitive deficits associated with glucose hypometabolism in AD .	1:CID:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	4-5	7-9	D005690	galactose|d -
